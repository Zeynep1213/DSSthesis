I’m staying on as long as the prime minister wants. I’m a Liberal, and I will always support and be proud of what we’ve done and keep pushing us to do more.\n","\n","But, you know, it’s time to move on in life. There are other things I want to do, and there are different angles on climate. But I’m always going to be there; I’m not leaving my party, nor am I leaving climate action in Canada. I’m just looking at the other ways that I can contribute. Some of the lessons from Canada could be useful for the rest of the world.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","So is it incorrect to say you’re quitting politics? How would you describe what you’re doing?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","People say I’m retired, and I’m not even 50 yet! I’m just looking at other ways to serve. I also want to spend time with my kids. When I started, they were 4, 6, and 8. Now they’re teenagers. I want to do things with them, too.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","I hope you get the time with them. But you didn’t answer my original question — how are your colleagues reacting?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","People have been very gracious.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","By people, do you mean those within your party, or is it also people from across the political spectrum?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","In my party, and Canadians. I think people in my community know that I worked hard. Some people were not very happy about the misogynistic treatment I got from opponents of climate action. I’m not leaving because of that. We’ve got to fight it, and it’s not okay, and I see it everywhere. Katharine Hayhoe, the climate scientist who’s Canadian but working in the US, also gets it. Politicians, in particular those working in climate, get it.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","In the past, you’ve dismissed these attacks as ”noise.” What advice do you have for how women considering politics can rise above such attacks?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","Get into politics. It matters. We will change things if we have more women in politics, and I will support you.\n","\n","I am working on a personal project called Running Like a Girl to support women and girls in politics at all levels. One of the girls said, “I’m going to run for my student council.” She just announced it because she felt solidarity with the group, and guess what? She won. Another woman announced she was going to run for mayor. She regretted it because it can be difficult for women to decide to get into politics. You have to be asked many times. She decided to do it even though she denounced it to the world by tweet and wanted to take it back. But she won.\n","\n","I’m all for vigorous debate, I’m no shrinking violet, but it’s not okay to have to put up with some of the garbage women and other marginalized groups put up with. So I’m going to work to stop that and empower new voices in politics. That’s the only way it’s going to change, and it’s also how we’re going to tackle big issues from climate to social justice issues.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","On a scale of one to 10, how optimistic are you that Canada will achieve its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","I would say a nine. The government is all-in. The only reason I don’t say 10 is because we’re a federation in Canada. That requires the provinces to be all-in, too. We still have some provinces with politicians who don’t seem to understand the urgency of climate action or the economic opportunity it presents. We went to the Supreme Court, and we won in terms of the federal government being able to put a price on carbon pollution across the country. Even the Conservative Party now has said there should be a price on pollution, and it can’t be free to pollute. So we’re making some progress.\n","\n","But most of all, I believe in Canadians. The last election was tough, but most Canadians supported a party that believes in ambitious climate action, including a price on pollution. I don’t think it’s possible anymore to have a government that isn’t committed to climate action.\n","\n","Just this summer, the town of Lytton burned to the ground. We’re going to have forest fires across the country, especially in the west. Climate change is becoming an air quality and a safety issue for many of these communities. And so I think Canadians understand that climate change is real, and we don’t have time to waste.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","What about Canada’s powerful oil and gas industry? You’ve faced criticism because Canada is the only G7 nation whose emissions have grown since the Paris Agreement. Do you have faith that the country will be able to cut its oil production?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","That’s why we have a climate plan that is based on science and evidence. The oil and gas sector has to get with the program. The world is changing. And it’s about energy — not just oil and gas, but how we are powering our homes, schools, and cars and in our businesses. There are different opportunities to cut emissions.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","But what do you think will make Canada’s oil and gas companies finally get with the program?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","First of all, you have to regulate. We now have major pieces in place, from a price on pollution to a clean fuel standard to phasing out coal. Those policies must be in place.\n","\n","But also, to do good business, you have to see where the future is going or you will not exist. That’s just the reality. When you have a major investor like BlackRock pouring trillions of dollars moving to a cleaner future, that is the signal. There’s been substantial work done on climate risk and climate disclosure and the risk to shareholders. I think that is really up to the government, but it’s partly up to business and oil and gas to understand that.\n","\n","We need to drive all infrastructure investments from the climate lens of resilience, adaptation, and mitigation. When I talked to my American friends, including US climate envoy John Kerry, I realized how challenging it was internationally.\n","\n","I don’t know what I’m going to do. I haven’t figured out whether I want to start something to build on things going on, but I think we must all get into the space of being very practical. And so that’s what I’m trying to figure out: How can I do something practical, probably on the international front?\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","You said climate work has to be practical. Does that mean Canada’s climate politics are impractical?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","I think we’ve been super practical.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","So why not keep going?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","Internationally, I don’t think we’re as practical as we need to be.

As one of the world’s top emitters, many might argue that you have enough on your plate at home.\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","Canada has a plan and now needs to grind away at implementing it. And that’s what’s happening.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","So are you leaving in the toughest moment?\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","The toughest moment was when we didn’t have a plan, and we had to fight for a plan, and I was getting attacked on all sides, including by premiers. Then, finally, we were able to land a price on pollution.\n","\n","I faced something called “the resistance” — five or six white men who resisted the prime minister, our climate plan, and carbon pricing. It became a meme. It was a thing.\n","\n","I wish we didn’t have to fight, but you have to fight on climate. But you also have to realize that people will support you if you are reasonable. We had a former prime minister, Jean Chrétien, who’s been a mentor to me. He said to me, “Canadians are reasonable, so be reasonable.”\n","\n","I think that is the thing. People who care about climate have to be reasonable and practical. We have to focus on people, jobs, economic opportunity. Focus on reducing emissions.\n","\n","I look at what’s going on in the United States and the Biden administration. It’s so nice that they’re back on climate because it was extremely hard, including internationally, with the Trump administration, to keep the momentum going and prevent everyone from giving up on climate action. And huge kudos to American states and cities, and the private sector, because they never stopped.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","But even though Biden has a climate plan, environmental advocates are having a tough time passing it and are now wondering if the infrastructure package will include climate at all.\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","Now you have to do the hard work.\n","\n","Jariel Arvin\n","\n","But that’s what I was saying, that implementing the plan is the hardest part!\n","\n","Catherine McKenna\n","\n","But in Canada, we’re already implementing it. We’re beyond that — we’re moving forward. We got the policies. We got the investment dollars.\n","\n","I don’t think the work is ever going to stop. By your logic, I should be working in politics on climate change until 2050. We’ve got a plan and a solution. People need to grind away. We need to increase climate ambition — that’s the whole point of the Paris Agreement every five years, increasing ambition. Now I can help other countries in other ways. And that’s always been my view. How do you contribute? The only thing that matters now is climate. But we need the whole world to have a plan. Lots of people have targets, but we need serious plans.\n","\n","I did my part here. I’ve done what I came to do, and that’s just the truth. I wanted Canada to be in a much more positive place on climate. I wanted to be very practical.

Are you doing any consulting work? Is the administration reaching out to you at all?\n","\n","Daniel Baer: I actually think the White House is doing a pretty good job of recognizing that they need to not only have press conferences, but also talk to other people who are trying to figure out how to be constructive critics, idea generators from the outside.\n","\n","Blade: OK, so you’re being solicited and engaging on this issue. My next question for you is why do you think Putin is doing this at this time?\n","\n","Baer: So, I guess taking a step back from the whole thing, one of the things about a problem like this is that everybody is searching for the right answer assuming that there is a like comfortable or compelling or intellectually accurate answer, and I actually think we’re just in a really hard moment.\n","\n","I don’t know why he’s doing it now. And in fact, I think that one of the puzzles that we haven’t solved yet is that all the things that he says are the reasons that he’s doing it — that he feels encirclement by NATO, … or that the situation in Ukraine is untenable — none of those things have changed. Setting aside the fact that they’re spurious, it’s not like there’s been some new move in the last 12 months that has precipitated [a reaction] on any of those fronts that you can say, “Oh, well, he’s responding to the recent meeting where Ukraine was offered membership in NATO, or he’s responding to a change in government in Ukraine that it’s clearly anti-Russia, or any other move that we’ve done.” The explanation just doesn’t hold water, and so I think we need to look for alternative ones.\n","\n","The best I can come up with is actually just a broad — it doesn’t actually explain this particular moment, but I think you could look at the timing of his life. He has, I don’t know, 10 years left. And during those 10 years, it’s unlikely that Russia is going to grow more powerful; it’s much more likely that it’s going to become at least relatively and probably nominally less powerful. And so, if you’re unhappy with the status quo, and you feel like you’re a declining power, and you don’t have endless time, there’s no time like the present. And you’ll make up whatever reasons you need to in order to justify it.\n","\n","I also think there’s a tendency on our part to attribute far more “strategery” to Putin than there necessarily is. I mean, he’s a bully and a thug. I think the whole Putin’s playing chess and we’re playing checkers is actually completely inverted. We’re in our own heads that there’s some kind of nuanced position that would mollify him. He’s just a gangster and he’s taking a punch because he has one. And I don’t think it gets much more complicated than that. And so, I guess the answer to why he’s doing this now, because the international conditions are such that he feels like the United States is focused domestically, the Ukrainians are not moving forward with succeeding to build — they’re kind of in stasis on building a European state— and he has, you know, he has the space to take a punch, so he’s contemplating doing it, or he’s already decided to do it. And he’s just extracting as much as possible before he takes it.\n","\n","Blade: That leads me to my next question: What is your judgement of the risk of out and out war?\n","\n","Baer: I don’t know because I have two hypotheses that cut both ways. One is that I think Putin is vastly underestimating the degree of resistance. On the other hand, I think that nothing short of domination is satisfactory. And so, I don’t know. I guess I think there’s a 90 percent chance that he does something, and I think there’s a 75 percent chance that what he does is not an all out invasion or ground invasion, at least not at first, but rather something that is aimed at confusing us. So some sort of hybrid or staged or false flag kind of attack in tandem with a political coup in Kiev, where he works to install a more Russia-loyal leader.\n","\n","The thing with the ground invasion is that Russian soldiers’ moms are one of the only, like, powerful political forces in civil society in Russia. I just don’t see any way that a ground invasion doesn’t involve massive Russian casualties, even if they will be dominant. The people who are going to impose the consequences on him will be the Ukrainians, not the rest of us, and he should not invade, and if he does, we should, frankly, work hard to make it as painful and difficult for him as possible.\n","\n","Blade: What will that look like?\n","\n","Baer: I think we should at that point continue — we shouldn’t pause, we should continue to send the defensive equipment and backfill as much as possible their ability from an equipment basis to resist.\n","\n","Blade: So if we were to look at a model for past U.S. engagements. I’m thinking Greece under President Truman, which was so successful that nobody really knows about it, I don’t think. Is there any model we should be looking toward, or not looking toward?\n","\n","Baer: No, I guess. I’m not sure there’s any good historical model because obviously, any of them you can pick apart. I do think that one thing that has gotten lost in a lot of the analysis — and this goes back to Putin being a gangster thug, and not being such a genius — is there’s a moral difference between us. The reason why Putin gets to control the dialogue is because he’s willing to do things that we aren’t willing to do — as gangsters are, as hostage-takers are — and so yes, they get to set the terms of what we discussed, because we’re not holding hostages. We’re trying to get hostages released. And the hostage-taker has an upper hand and asymmetry because they are willing to do something that is wrong.\n","\n","We shouldn’t lose the kind of moral difference there. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that Ukraine is being menaced. And I’m not saying it’s our obligation [to intervene militarily], certainly not our obligation. They aren’t a treaty ally. We have neither a political obligation nor a moral one to necessarily risk our own lives, our own soldiers in defense of Ukraine. But if Ukraine wants to defend themselves, there’s a strong moral case to be made that anything, short of risking our own lives, is something that is morally good. We generally believe that self-defense from lethal threat is a reasonable moral cause and assisting others in defending themselves is too — I think there’s a lot of back and forth that get glossed over whether that’s a provocation or whatever, and I want to say to people stand back, look at this: we’ve got one party that is attacking another. And the question is, does the other have a right to defend itself? Yes. And if they have a right to defend themselves, and they also have a right to have whatever assistance people will offer them in defending themselves.\n","\n","That doesn’t mean that they get to demand that we show up and fight in the trenches with them, of course, and I don’t think there’s any serious people who are recommending that but it’s a good thing to help them. It’s not like a technical thing. It’s a good thing to help\n","\n","Blade: Getting into that moral background, one thing I want to ask you was about the significance of what would happen in this concept of democracy versus autocracy. First of all, how much is Ukraine a functional democracy, in the sense that if we’re defending Ukraine, we are defending a democracy, and what signal do you think it would send if that Ukrainian government fell to Russian autocracy?\n","\n","Baer: I think the institutions of government that the Ukrainian people have are not worthy of the Ukrainian people’s own demonstrated commitment …\n","\n","They are not worthy of the Ukrainian people’s own demonstrated commitment to the idea of democratic institutions. So the answer is today’s Ukrainian government is a mixed bag and it’s very hard to build, on the rot of a Russian fiefdom, a functioning democracy, so I think it’s a mixed bag. I don’t want to sound like I’m minimizing [the changes], or that they’ve completely bungled an easy project. It was always going to be a hard project, and it was never going to be linear.\n","\n","But I think that what we’ve seen from the Ukrainian people — by which I mean not Ukrainian people, but people of Ukraine — is that there is a broad part of society that a) does not want to live under a Russian thumb and b) sees its future in kind of European style democracy. And so I think that if there was, there’s no question that the Russian attack would be in part about subjugating the people of Ukraine and forcing them to live under some sort of new Russian satellite. And I think that there’s little space for serious argument that that’s something that the people of the country wish to have.\n","\n","Blade: But I’m just kind of getting at — you’re kind of minimizing that this is a strategic move by Putin, but if he were to successfully dominant Ukraine it becomes a Russian satellite isn’t that saying like, “Well, ha ha West, you thought the Cold War was over and there’s going to be just be a unipolar world in the future but no, we’re gonna we have this we’re back and we’re gonna create a multipolar world for the future.”\n","\n","Baer: Yeah, I mean, my answer to the Russians who always raise the multipolar world to me is, “Fine, it’s going to be a multipolar world. What makes you think that Russia is one of the poles?” Poles by definition draw people to them, they are compelling and a pole attracts, magnetically or otherwise, and there is nothing attractive about the model that Russia is pursuing. And if the only way that you can be a pole is by subjugating, to force your neighbors, you are proving that you are not one.\n","\n","I think the benefits for Russia are far smaller than Putin thinks and I think the consequences for the rest of the world of allowing a violation of international order to go forward are much larger than many people recognize.\n","\n","Blade: But that was their approach when they were the Soviet Union. They were subjugating the Eastern Bloc through Russian force. They did have, in theory, the concept of their worldview of you know, of socialism, or whatever you want to put it charitably, was going to be the right way to go. Is there really that much of a difference?\n","\n","Baer: Yeah, however disingenuous it was, they did have an ideology . So you’re right, that was a key distinction. The other thing is that the Soviet Union in relative size — its economy and population etc. — was much larger than Russia is today. And Russia is shrinking, and its economy is less diverse than the Communist one was. I think it’s a delusion to think that they’re going to kind of rebuild an empire, even if yes, because of their willingness to do awful things, they could potentially for a time politically control through violence, their neighbors. I just don’t — in a multipolar world, I don’t see Russia being one of the poles, at least not on its current path.\n","\n","Blade: How would you evaluate the U.S. diplomatic approach to this issue?\n","\n","Baer: There’s been very clear over-the-top effort to include the Europeans at every step — meetings with them before each meeting and after each meeting, to force conversations into fora that are more inclusive and stuff like that. And I think that Secretary Blinken is rightly recognizing the need to kind of play a role of kind of keeping everybody on the side while we test whether diplomacy whether there’s anything to do, whether there’s any promise with diplomacy.\n","\n","I think there’s kind of, sometimes kind of, two camps in U.S. foreign policy circles. One is like: We should give the Russians what they want because it just doesn’t matter that much. War is much worse than anything that we would give them. And another is that we can’t give them an inch and we have to punch them in the face whenever we can. And I think both of those are kind of knee-jerk positions that have become a bit religious for people and neither of them is paying attention to the practical challenge that’s in front of the administration, which is like this guy’s threatening to invade and we need to identify whether there’s any opportunity for a functional off ramp, and that doesn’t mean we do that in a vacuum and ignore the long-term consequences, but our problem is not a religious one, it’s a practical one. And I think they’re doing a pretty good job of threading the needle on that and being not too far forward and not too far back.\n","\n","Blade: Do you see any significant daylight between the United States and Europe?\n","\n","Baer: No, I mean, no more than the minimum that is possible. There’s a lot of talk about Germany these days. Look, I think some of the things they say are not particularly helpful, but I don’t actually think that in the long run, if Putin invaded, I don’t think that they would hold up sanctions or anything like that. So I think they’re on our side, even if they’re talking out of both sides, in some cases.\n","\n","Blade: I am wise to the fact that this is a nuclear power. It might be a little old school, but could escalation get that far?\n","\n","Baer: There can’t be war. There can’t be war between NATO and Russia. It should be avoided. Obviously, there can be, but it should be avoided.\n","\n","Blade: How committed do you think President Biden is to protecting Ukraine?\n","\n","Baer: Reasonably so. I think he’s enough of an old school trans-Atlantist that he understands that this isn’t just about Ukraine.\n","\n","Blade: I was wondering because he had those comments from his press conference about “minor incursion” and I’m just wondering if you’re reading anything into that or not.\n","\n","Baer: No, I think that was that was a — I think broadly speaking, everything he says is in line with the kind of view that you would expect. And of course, one sentence can catch [attention]. That wasn’t what he meant. What he meant was that he didn’t want to draw a “red line” that would prejudge policy in response to something short of the most extreme scenario.\n","\n","I think it is a good caution to not obsess over a single sentence and to look at the broad considered policy statements.\n","\n","Blade: What do you think if you were looking for developments, like what would you be looking out for is significant in terms of where we are going to be going in the near future? This is one thing to keep an eye out for but is there anything else that you are kind of looking out for in terms of the near future?\n","\n","Baer: I guess I would look out for whether or not the United States joins meetings of the so-called Normandy Format, which is the France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia grouping, which has so far been unsuccessful, but I think can only be successful as the United States joins it, but the Russians, I think have misgivings with the idea of our joining it.\n","\n","Blade: I’m not at all familiar with that. What makes this forum particularly so —\n","\n","Baer: So it was started in the summer in like June of 2015, on the margins of some meeting between Merkel and Hollande. The French and the Germans are very committed to the idea that they might be able to mediate peace between Ukraine and Russia. It was supposed to implement the Minsk Agreement, and it just hasn’t been productive so far. I don’t think that the Russians will do anything — I don’t think the Ukrainians feel comfortable negotiating anything without the Americans at the table. And I don’t think the Russians feel like anything is guaranteed without the Americans at the table. So I just, I’m fine with France and Germany taking the lead, but I think the U.S. has to be there.\n","\n","And there was a meeting of this group in Paris yesterday, and which the U.S. was supportive of, and so I’m watching to see whether or not the United States gets added in some ad hoc way, whether there are future meetings. I guess the reason I would watch it, if the U.S. were to join future meetings that would signal to me that it’s actually there’s some diplomacy happening there.\n","\n","That’s meant to be focusing mainly on the existing Russian invasion, the occupation of the Donbas, so that’s not about the threat of the new invasion, but it would be interesting to me if there was forward movement on other parts of Ukraine. The announcement of the American ambassador is one. I think that last week movement of troops into Belarus was a game changer for the U.S., because there are all kinds of new implications if you’re using a third country as your launchpad for war, and so it complicates things and it also looks more serious if you’re starting to deploy to third countries and stuff like that. So I think that was that last week, you noticed a difference in the U.S. tone and tenor in response to that.\n","\n","So things like that. But in general, like what I would do and I don’t think people always catch this is because there’s a boiling frog aspect to it. There are statements coming out from the White House or State Department. Almost every day on stuff related to this and like last week, there was a noticeable change in the tenor as the U.S. became less, I think more pessimistic about the prospects of diplomacy and those I don’t have anything better to look for in those statements as tea leaves, in terms of what the U.S. assessment is of the prospects of the escalation are, so it’s bad.\n","\n","Blade: Right. That’s very sobering.\n","\n","There’s a lot of talk, and I’ve just been seeing some like about in terms of, there’s like comparisons to Afghanistan and making sure that all Americans are able to get out of Ukraine. Is that comparing apples to oranges?\n","\n","Baer: Yes.\n","\n","Blade: And could you unpack that a little bit? I mean, I can kind of guess the reasons why. How is that apples to oranges?\n","\n","Blade: Well, the level of development in Ukraine in terms of infrastructure and transport and stuff like that is not comparable to Afghanistan. I think it would be– if there were a Russian invasion–you would definitely want to, obviously, for safety reasons, it’s not safe to be in a war zone, so you would want people to be able to evacuate and you’d have to plan for that.\n","\n","A major concern [in Afghanistan] was also that there were tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of locals who had worked for the Americans. The Americans that are in Ukraine are not a departing occupying power. There’s just not the same footprint there — the Americans are in Ukraine or there as business people or young [people working on] democracy assistance or whatever. And it’s just it’s a different context.\n","\n","Blade: Why do you think the Russians put up with Putin? I mean, this is a country that was a world power and I would think has some economic potential just given its sheer size, first of all, and they do have oil to offer people. So why aren’t the Russians like angry at him for obstructing their participation in the global order as opposed to just putting up with him for years and years and years.\n","\n","Baer: Successful instrumentalisation of cynicism. The lack of a belief in an alternative will keep you from fighting for it.\n","\n","Blade: That’s pretty succinct.\n","\n","Baer: I mean, I don’t think there’s any question that the people of Russia could be better off or different in terms of kitchen table issues, and ease of navigating the world, prospects for their future for their children’s future. The amount of money that Putin has invested into military modernization that Russia can ill afford, while he’s cut pensions and social services and health care. It’s just it’s objectively true that the average Russian person would be better served by a different leader. But he’s done a very good job of effectively selling off the country for profit and persuading people through repression and propaganda that there is no alternative.\n","\n","Blade: And Putin won’t be around forever. Once he finally goes, is an alternative going to emerge, or will it be the next guy in Putin’s mold?\n","\n","Baer: I think it’s far from clear that what comes after Putin isn’t worse and bloody. Regimes like this don’t reliably have stable transitions.\n","\n","Blade: Wow, okay.\n","\n","Baer: Yeah, we shouldn’t… we should be careful about wishing… wishing for his demise.\n","\n","Blade: That’s good to know. It’s kind of a frightful note for me to end my questions. But actually before I sign off, there’s one more thing too because I do kind of want to talk about the intersection about your old job in democracy and human rights and then a Venn diagram of that with your experience in Eastern Europe in particular. Do you have a sense of what’s at stake for LGBTQ people in Ukraine or if they’re in more danger right now than they would be otherwise?\n","\n","Baer: That’s a good question. I mean, my knee jerk reaction is yes. That — as mixed of a picture as Ukraine has been in the last seven years, or eight years — there have been meaningful steps forward, and certainly, in terms of visibility.\n","\n","I guess, in the sense that Ukraine is better than Russia today, if you’re gay, if Russia is going to occupy or control Ukraine we can expect that it will get worse because it will become more like Russia.\n","['Christian Monterrosa Ap'] 2021-06-25 19:56:38.320000 Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer found guilty of murdering George Floyd, will spend more than 22 years behind bars.\n","\n","His sentencing Friday comes just hours after his team unsuccessfully tried to throw out the original verdict, a sign that they may launch an appeal.\n","\n","Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill handed down the sentence following four victim impact statements from Floyd's friends and family, including his 7-year-old daughter Gianna, his nephew Brandon Williams who said his family \"is forever broken,\" and Floyd's brother Terrence.\n","\n","Chauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, spoke on his behalf saying she will always support him, believes in his \"innocence,\" and said, \"the public will never know the loving and caring man he is but his family does.\"\n","\n","Chauvin, dressed in a gray suit, spoke briefly at the hearing and stated his condolences to the Floyd family, but added: \"There's going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest.

He supported its use in the past to protect the Democratic Party’s say in the political process, so he has to support it now — even if it hinders the Democratic agenda.\n","\n","Manchin’s consistency is encouraging, especially since the rest of his party abandoned it as soon as Biden took office. Just a few years ago, in 2017, dozens of Manchin’s colleagues signed a letter in 2017 urging Senate GOP leadership not to cave to former President Donald Trump’s demands to toss it. They argued the filibuster was vital, that compromise would not be possible without it, and that abolishing it would set a horrible precedent. Apparently, Manchin was the only one who actually believed that.\n","\n","Even Biden, who once said gutting the filibuster would “eviscerate the Senate and turn it into the House of Representatives” and “upset the constitutional design,” now says he would support Democrats’ efforts to get rid of it. There is only one reason for this, as Manchin noted in a recent op-ed:\n","\n","“It has been said by much wiser people than me that absolute power corrupts absolutely,” Manchin wrote. “Well, what I’ve seen during my time in Washington is that every party in power will always want to exercise absolute power, absolutely.”\n","\n","Manchin is right. The only reason Democrats want to get rid of the filibuster now is because it’s the only thing standing in their way. It’s an obvious power grab, and they shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it. Thankfully, Manchin won’t let them.\n","Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/arizona-hobbs-do-audit-right-or-dont-at-all on URL https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/arizona-hobbs-do-audit-right-or-dont-at-all\n","[] 2020-08-25 01:40:56.840000 The couple who wielded weapons at Black Lives Matter protesters from their St. Louis home's front lawn urged the country to rally around President Trump because Democrats won't protect them.\n","\n","\"Whether it’s defunding the police, ending cash bail so criminals can be released back out on the streets the same day to riot again, or encouraging anarchy on our streets, it seems as if Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens,\" Mark McCloskey told the Republican National Convention on Monday.\n","\n","Wife Patricia McCloskey added, \"These are the policies that are coming to a neighborhood near you.

Omar pushed back against her Democratic colleagues following the event and has continued to make such remarks publicly.\n","\n","Despite, or perhaps because of, the controversy over her comments, Omar and Tlaib (the latter regularly defends Omar's remarks), both saw spikes in campaign contributions, filings show.\n","\n","Throughout the first quarter of the year, which spans from Jan. 1 to March 31, Omar's campaign pulled $822,024.29 in contributions from individuals, $414,000 of which came from small donors, or individuals providing less than $200 in total contributions to the campaign.\n","\n","Most of the money was raised by the campaign following the Feb. 27 event that led to a stream of public headaches for Democrats. Omar's campaign hauled in just $24,331 in contributions in January while taking in $115,007 in donations in February—$23,360 of which came the day after the D.C. townhall event with Tlaib.\n","\n","However, throughout March the congresswoman hauled in $265,429 in donations, according to an analysis of her campaign records.\n","\n","Three of Omar's biggest days this year all came in March. On March 29, the campaign was given $49,400; on March 5 the campaign reported $45,397; and on March 27, the committee saw $29,360 in donations.\n","\n","A closer look at the data reveals a notable jump in contributions to Omar in the period specifically following her and Tlaib's Busboys and Poets appearance. In the pre-appearance period, she raised an average of $6,443 per day; after her appearance, that figure jumps to $11,552 per day on average.\n","\n","Tlaib also experienced a drastic increase in campaign contributions at the same time as Omar.\n","\n","Federal Election Commission filings show that Tlaib's campaign received $313,317.65 in individual contributions, $70,000 of which came from small donors. Tlaib's campaign committee pulled in just $36,430 combined throughout January and February.\n","\n","However, the congresswoman was the recipient of $206,817 in campaign contributions from individuals throughout March.

In the pre-appearance period, she averaged just $1,179 per day in contributions; after the appearance, that figure rises to $7,146, driven by a number of major March appearances.\n","\n","The lion's share of Omar's funding comes not from her home state of Minnesota, which gave her just under $10,000 in the first three months of 2019, but from Massachusetts.

David Valadao wasn't decided until weeks after Election Day, and was won by less than a thousand votes, suggesting his hold on the seat is likely tenuous in a district in California's San Joaquin Valley.\n","\n","An interview on local television station KSEE that aired over the weekend comes as the largest paper in his congressional district has published a string of articles raising questions about some of the congressman's business dealings, taxes, and financial disclosures.\n","\n","The latest of those articles, published early Tuesday morning by the McClatchy-owned Fresno Bee, said Cox \"has a complicated financial history that includes multiple tax liens and a delinquent debt that caused the Fresno County Sheriff's Office to warn him that it could seize his property.\"\n","\n","The nonprofit under scrutiny, the Central Valley Community Sports Foundation (CVCSF) was begun in 2015 by local developer Terance Frazier, primarily to run a city sports park that has had a troubled history. Cox was the foundation's treasurer from its inception.\n","\n","Under the arrangement between the CVCSF and the city, the nonprofit pledged $2.7 million in upgrades to the outdoor sports park and would take over the yearly management. The city would pay the CVCSF $150,000 per year for the management, slightly less than what the government had been allocating in their own budget.\n","\n","However, last August, Frazier approached the city to increase its financial contribution, which then triggered a clause in the contract allowing the city to perform an audit, and a Bee article shortly after raised questions about how much investment had actually occurred.\n","\n","\"During the initial review, Internal Audit determined that CVCSF's internal controls were deficient to nonexistent,\" one of the findings read. Other conclusions by the audit team found the nonprofit's checkbook was not balanced correctly, contracts were sometimes made verbally, and multiple payments had been made to \"corporate officers\" of the nonprofit that were questionable.\n","\n","\"In February 2017, two Corporate Officers of CVCSF withdrew $145,140.76 and $75,000 respectively as ‘loan repayments,'\" it noted. \"However, these withdrawals were made before there was evidence that the individuals had provided any such loans to the non-profit.\"\n","\n","It's not clear if Cox was one of the corporate officers mentioned.\n","\n","Cox had not provided substantive comment about the audit to media requests from multiple outlets including the Washington Free Beacon, but finally addressed the issues with KSEE in an interview that aired Sunday.\n","\n","\"There's a—to a certain extent—no good deed goes unpunished,\" Cox began. \"You know, that was a site, as you know, I mean it was 20 acres of wheat. It was a public nuisance. It was a homeless encampment. Right? And Terance came along with assistance from me, and they turned it into this public recreational facility, at no risk to the city, no cost to the city, right? Less than they were spending before. That's being used by thousands of people every day, right?\"\n","\n","\"I kind of just wish that they would just say ‘Thank you so much for what you've done,' right, to make this available to the city.\"\n","\n","For more than six weeks, the Washington Free Beacon has made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain a copy of the 2017 IRS 990 form for the CVCSF, a document that is essentially the tax return for the nonprofit and supposed to be available by law.\n","\n","A document from March shows the congressman severed his ties with the CVCSF that month, and the Fresno County district attorney's office has launched an investigation into the audit as well.\n","\n","Two weeks ago, the Fresno Bee published a story noting that Cox \"failed to disclose several business interests during his most recent congressional candidacies, including the fact that he sits on the board of a for-profit Canadian mining company[.]\"\n","\n","Cox complained to KSEE that the Bee's reporting omitted information, but his response was also less than straightforward.\n","\n","\"What they forgot to tell you is, any of these things—and there wasn't any of them where—one, they were already shut down, had no assets or revenues. That's uh, that would've been a very pertinent piece of information.\"\n","\n","Cox's congressional office did not respond to requests by the Beacon for a clarification on those remarks.\n","\n","The same report also raised questions about whether he had disclosed possible rental income on a home in Fresno, and the congressman's office did not respond to the Bee's questions on those issues.\n","\n","In the KSEE interview, Cox indicated he thought the article was implying that he had skirted disclosure laws, and called it \"inaccurate.\"\n","\n","\"If a news organization has some kind of agenda, I can't worry about that,\" he said.\n","\n","The most recent report by the Bee, which came after the television interview, breaks new ground on other business dealings already receiving scrutiny.\n","\n","\"Some of his financial entanglements were reported during his 2018 congressional campaign, including an IRS lien against him and his wife,\" the report said. \"McClatchy has obtained new records showing that the Fresno County Sheriff's Office was involved in collecting an arbitration payment five years ago, as well as recent liens against two of his companies.\"\n","\n","Cox's office did not respond to a request for comment on the newest article by the Bee.\n","\n","When asked about the disclosure issues, the audit, and whether the congressman provided information to the Bee on stories he claims omitted key information, Cox's office only response was to point to an article also in the Bee.

Their votes put them at odds with not just the general public, but Democratic voters. A vast majority of voters, including those who identify as pro-choice, support providing care to newborns who survive abortion; 70 percent of Democrats, 75 percent of independents, and 86 percent of Republicans back the policy, according to the McLaughlin & Associates poll commissioned by the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List.\n","\n","The bill would have required doctors to provide care for infants who survive late term abortions, rather than letting those born alive die on the table. A 2016 study posted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that 60 percent of babies born at 22 weeks gestation—what is commonly seen as the borderline of viability—were able to survive when they received \"active care\" from doctors. Pro-life activists say they plan to make the vote a centerpiece of the 2020 campaign. Terry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles project, said the vote cleared up the party's abortion ideology, moving the needle far beyond the \"safe, legal, and rare\" rhetoric once championed by Bill Clinton.\n","\n","\"Their refusal to protect the lives of newborn babies ought in any sane political climate to immediately disqualify them not only from the White House but also from holding political office altogether,\" he said. \"By standing with radical pro-abortion activists and against the majority of Americans, Democrats have handed President Trump a significant advantage heading into 2020.\"\n","\n","The Trump administration supported the bill. It released a policy statement ahead of the vote, saying the legislation would \"prevent infanticide\" and \"ensure that the life of one baby is not treated as being more or less valuable than another.\"\n","\n","\"The bill draws a sorely needed bright line of protection around abortion survivors by requiring that they be given the same level of care as any other premature infant,\" the administration said. \"A baby that survives an abortion, and is born alive into this world should be treated just like any other baby.\"\n","\n","The bill did garner bipartisan in the 53-44 vote, as Sens. Bob Casey (D., Penn.), Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), and Doug Jones (D., Ala.) joined Republicans, though that was not enough to pass the 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.\n","\n","The 2020 Democratic candidates voted in favor of the position outlined by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam in a radio interview about legislation defending abortion.\n","\n","\"The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable,\" Northam said. \"The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\"\n","\n","Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said that the 2020 Democrats failed a vital test by toeing the party line at the expense of newborns. She said voters were \"horrified by infanticide.\" She said Trump had distinguished himself from his potential opponents by speaking out against Northam, and pledged to \"go on offense to hold Democratic presidential contenders accountable for their extremism and for trampling the will of the American people.\"\n","\n","\"When forced to take a position on the record, not a single one of the top Senate Democrats running for president in 2020 could muster the basic decency to outlaw infanticide,\" she said in a statement. \"President Trump's pro-life leadership is obviously resonating with the public and could not present a clearer contrast to Democrats' extremism.\"\n","\n","While the vote failed in the Senate, Republicans are pushing similar legislation in the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats.

Maureen Ferguson, a senior policy adviser at the Catholic Association, said that O'Rourke and his fellow Democrats could alienate voters in a general election. She also emphasized that the abortions in question center on babies capable of living outside of the womb thanks to advances in medical care.\n","\n","\"Cavalierly proclaiming support for third trimester abortion may be in vogue in today's Democratic primary for the 2020 candidates, but it's the wrong way to win a general election,\" Ferguson said. \"It's also endorsing infanticide; a baby in the 7th, 8th and 9th month of pregnancy is viable and can live outside the womb.\"\n","\n","Terry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles Project, said O'Rourke's stance contradicts the \"moderate\" image he cultivated during his political career. Schilling was not surprised by O'Rourke's shift given the state of abortion politics among liberals and the Democratic base.

Schilling expects that to change in 2020.\n","\n","\"Democrats are in a race to the bottom on abortion,\" Schilling said. \"The party litmus test is now enthusiastic support for third-trimester abortions—and Beto just passed with flying colors.\"\n","\n","Late-term abortion has become a defining issue for Democratic presidential hopefuls in the wake of New York passing legislation that allows abortion up until the point of birth.

The returns indicated that Sanders is now a millionaire, having collected more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 thanks to the sales from his books Our Revolution and Bernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution.\n","\n","Sanders dodged questions about his new-found wealth during a Monday night townhall on Fox, declining to say if he would pay a top tax rate of 52 percent, the highest bracket proposed during his 2016 run for the White House. He also did not respond to a question from Fox's Martha MacCallum about if he would voluntarily give money to the government to bring his tax bill up to what he thought a fair rate was.\n","\n","If he did, or if his tax plan were implemented, Sanders would increase his tax liability by nearly 30 percent, analysis of his tax returns indicates.\n","\n","Sanders has not announced any substantive changes to the income tax system during his 2020 run. However, during his 2016 run, Sanders floated a comprehensive overhaul to the tax system in order to help pay for his proposed Medicare-for-All plan.\n","\n","According to analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, Sanders's 2016 proposal would add four new top tax brackets with rates of 37 percent, 43 percent, 48 percent, and 52 percent, It would also add a 2.2 percent \"income-based [health care] premium paid by households,\" which the Tax Foundation writers say is \"equivalent to increasing all tax bracket rates by 2.2 percentage points.\"\n","\n","Using the Tax Foundation's estimates of Sanders's brackets, as well as the senator's reported 2018 taxable income of $519,529, we can estimate a total tax liability under his schema of $170,240.11. If Sanders were paying taxes under his own plan, he would be shelling out an additional $36,819.11 to the government, and have a tax liability of 32.7 percent of his income.\n","\n","Luckily for his finances, Sanders does not live under his own tax regime. Rather, Sanders enjoyed a tax cut thanks to the TCJA, just like millions of other Americans.\n","\n","\"Ever since President Trump signed the Republican-sponsored tax bill in December 2017, independent analyses have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law,\" New York Times reporters Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley wrote on Sunday. \"Preliminary data based on tax filings has shown the same.\"\n","\n","Multiple tax-policy think tanks have provided tools to estimate tax liability with and without the TCJA.

(Note: these estimators make a number of assumptions, and so may not perfectly reflect Sanders's real tax liability without the TCJA.)\n","\n","One tool, provided by the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of the left-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institute) estimates that Sanders's income tax liability without the TCJA would have been $144,451; with the tax law, it fell to $106,782, a drop of $37,669.

While President Donald Trump has promised a \"maximum pressure\" campaign to choke off Tehran's resources, the State and Treasury Departments have advocated in favor of waivers permitting Iran to continue sensitive nuclear work as well as its lucrative oil trade.\n","\n","The debate has split certain elements of the Trump administration and will come to a head in the coming weeks as a series of sanctions waivers permitting eight countries to continue purchasing Iranian crude oil is set to expire in May.\n","\n","Already, some elements of the administration are pushing to issue another round of sanctions waivers, prompting outrage on Capitol Hill where multiple officials stand ready to fight that potential decision.\n","\n","At stake is the future of the Iranian nuclear deal itself, which has been on life support since Trump abandoned the agreement in pursuit of tough new sanctions. While the United States has withdrawn from the agreement, there remain elements of the Trump administration who view it as sacrosanct and are hoping to outlast the president. There is support for this position among many European allies who have been searching for ways to skirt U.S. sanctions and continue doing business with Iran.\n","\n","Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), a vocal opponent of the deal, told the Washington Free Beacon he is aware of elements within the Trump administration who are working behind the president's back to save the nuclear deal.\n","\n","\"A nuclear Iran is the most pressing near-term threat to American national security and to the survival of our Middle East allies,\" Cruz said. \"Every waiver for Iran either allows them to work toward their nuclear goal, or pays for terrorists to attack us, or both.\"\n","\n","\"The president understands that basic fact but it appears that not everyone in the administration is totally on board. Maximum pressure should mean maximum pressure,\" Cruz said. \"Enough's enough.\"\n","\n","The fight over new oil waivers, which the Free Beacon has reported on multiple times in recent months, is fracturing certain elements of the administration, particularly in the State Department, which has the power to issue sanctions waivers.\n","\n","It remains unclear which direction Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leaning. State Department officials took nearly a week to respond to Free Beacon requests for comment on the matter and would not provide a definitive answer.\n","\n","\"For now Secretary Pompeo has not made a decision,\" said one U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak on record. \"He is in listening mode.\"\n","\n","Pompeo is set for yet another trip to the Middle East for top-level meetings in Israel, where sanctions waivers are expected to be a topic of conversation among Israeli officials who want to see Iran's economy fully cut off.\n","\n","\"Our policy goal remains to get all countries to stop purchasing Iranian crude as quickly as possible,\" a State Department official told the Free Beacon. \"We continue to discuss our Iran-related sanctions with our partners to ensure continued compliance.

Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) told the Free Beacon. \"Given that international oil markets appear to have more than enough surplus capacity to offset losses of Iranian oil, it's time for the U.S. to take this step and truly maximize pressure against the terror-sponsoring and nuclear weapons-seeking regime in Tehran.\"\n","\n","Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) told the Free Beacon that the cash windfalls Iran receives from its lucrative oil trade go to fund its global terror operations, which have targeted U.S. forces in the region, as well as allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n","\n","\"The Iranian regime uses its petrodollars to fund terrorism and sow chaos throughout the region,\" Cotton said. \"Going forward, the proper amount of oil exports from Iran is zero.\"\n","\n","Iran hawks on Capitol Hill are said to have been further riled by a Monday Free Beacon report on Iran's construction of two new nuclear plants, which could provide Tehran with a plutonium pathway to the bomb. This type of nuclear work was permitted by the nuclear deal, and is still believed to be legal due to another series of waivers issued by the State Department allowing Iran to continue performing nuclear research, including at a site that once housed its nuclear weapons program. These waivers have become a second flashpoint in the inter-agency battle over the administration's Iran policy.\n","\n","There also is support for a hardline sanctions policy among Republican members in the House.\n","\n","\"The oil waiver issue gets to the heart of the matter: whether or not the United States should be engaged in a maximum pressure campaign against the Iranian regime,\" Rep.

It would also not reduce incarceration, as prisoners would be moved to public facilities and would likely leave untouched the many federal private prison detainees housed under the authority of the Department of Homeland Security.\n","\n","Biden's order instead follows private prisons' role as a popular scapegoat for advocates of \"criminal justice reform,\" who argued as far back as the Obama administration that profit-motivated corporations would tend to increase incarceration. That position is similar to other popular arguments—like advocacy for marijuana legalization on decarceration grounds—that allow proponents of reform to avoid talking about prisons' large population of violent offenders.\n","\n","In its specifics, the new order only requires that the Department of Justice not renew its contracts with \"privately operated criminal detention centers.\" It does not implicate detention centers administered by other departments. That may mean that private entities will still detain illegal aliens pending deportation, who account for \"the vast majority of contractor-operated facilities,\" according to the private prison group Day One Alliance.\n","\n","In other words, the Biden order may target a small share of a small share of offenders. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics indicate that private prisons hold just 7 percent of state prisoners and 16 percent of federal prisoners. In total, they detain roughly 116,000 of the roughly 1.4 million prisoners in the United States—the federal prisons that Biden's order would close house just 28,000 people or roughly 2 percent of the U.S. prison population.\n","\n","In fact, the BJS data show, the federal private prison population was already in decline, falling between 2018 and 2019. Just five states hold more than 20 percent of their prisoners in private prisons, while 18 states hold none at all.\n","\n","These facts did not stop \"criminal justice reform\" groups from praising Biden's executive order, with the ACLU's David Fathi calling it \"an important first step toward acknowledging the harm that has been caused and taking actions to repair it.\" It also garnered praise from the union representing some 30,000 federal prison workers, who stand to gain from the closing of competitors.\n","\n","Biden's order explicitly restarts an initiative of the last days of the Obama administration, which similarly prepared a phase-out in the months leading up to the 2016 election. Following his victory, President Donald Trump reversed that decision shortly after taking over the White House.\n","\n","That made it a popular punching bag in the ensuing years, particularly during the 2020 Democratic primary. Then, contenders such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Cory Booker (D., N.J.) took aim at it, as did now-Vice President Kamala Harris. Those candidates likely induced Biden to pull his criminal justice platform to the left, including endorsing an end to federal private prisons—part of a larger effort to shed a tough-on-crime image from his days in the Senate.\n","\n","Opposition to private prisons in the 2020 field followed that group's use of other popular progressive talking points on \"criminal justice reform,\" like the debunked claim that marijuana criminalization is a major driver of incarceration. Just as with prisoners in private prisons, marijuana offenders account for a small fraction of overall prisoners. In reality, 48 percent of prisoners are violent offenders, a fraction that has risen even as prison populations have shrunk over the past decade and a half.\n","['Charles Fain Lehman', 'Brent Scher'] 2019-02-14 10:00:17+00:00 Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) admitted in an interview this week to using marijuana, an act that landed thousands in prison while she was California's Attorney General and opposed legalization of the drug.\n","\n","The drug use admission to the \"Breakfast Club\" came as part of Harris' attempt to erase the reputation she earned as a California prosecutor. She is now calling for legalizing marijuana as a first step to end the War on Drugs, but opposed marijuana legalization during both her 2010 campaign for Attorney General and 2014 re-election campaign, when she notably lost support from the marijuana industry after she laughed at her Republican opponent for supporting legalization.\n","\n","Under Harris's six-year tenure, hundreds were sent to state prisons for marijuana-related offenses, crime records show.\n","\n","Possession of small quantities of marijuana (up to an ounce) for personal use has been decriminalized in California since 1975. However, sales of the drug remained illegal until 2018, when the commercial licensing portion of Proposition 64—the ballot measure that legalized weed state-wide—was implemented. That means that the state still arrested, prosecuted, and imprisoned people for marijuana-related offenses.\n","\n","The California Attorney General's office does not provide organized, publicly available data on annual prosecutions. When contacted by the Free Beacon, it could only point to its OpenJustice data portal, which reports only limited data sets. However, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation does provide data on the total number of admissions to state prisons annually, in its \"Offender Data Points\" series and the now-discontinued \"Characteristics of New Admissions\" series.\n","\n","These reports provide information on new admissions (as opposed to parole violators) to the California state prison system, including by offense type. Based on these reports, at least 1,560 people were sent to state prisons for marijuana-related offenses between 2011 and 2016.\n","\n","Importantly, this figure is necessarily an undercount of the total number of people actually prosecuted for marijuana offenses during Harris's term as Attorney General. The sharp decline between 2011 and 2012 is not a reflection of leniency on Harris's part, but because of something called Public Safety Realignment.\n","\n","A federal court found in 2011 that California's state-level prisons were dangerously overcrowded, ordering it to reduce populations to more manageable levels. To do so, the state began filtering many lower-level offenders—including drug offenders—into county jails, meaning that they dropped out of state-level totals but were still incarcerated.\n","\n","Under realignment, \"most lower-level offenders with no record of sexual, violent, or serious crimes now serve sentences in county jail or under county probation supervision,\" the Public Policy Institute of California noted in 2015.\n","\n","County-level populations ticked up following realignment, but no data source breaks those figures down by offense. As such it is not clear how many additional marijuana offenders were prosecuted under Harris and then diverted to county jails. As a result, 1,560 is the lower bound of individuals sent to prison by Harris for marijuana from 2011 to 2016.\n","\n","Harris said during her interview with the \"Breakfast Club\" that she supports legalizing marijuana because \"it gives a lot of people joy, and we need more joy.\"\n","\n","She also pushed back against those who say she opposed legalization. \"That is not true,\" Harris said. \"I joke about it, but half my family is from Jamaica. Are you kidding me?\"\n","\n","Many are also questioning whether she was being honest about the timeframe of her drug use. When she was asked what kind of music she listened to during her smoking days in college, she named two artists—Tupac and Snoop Dog—who weren't making music until long after she graduated.\n","\n","\"Either Harris was baked enough to time travel or she hit the bong after being in school,\" wrote Nick Gillespie for Reason, a libertarian magazine that supports marijuana legalization. \"Not cool for a candidate whose slogan is ‘speaking truth, demanding justice.'\"\n","['More Bill Scher'] 2021-05-12 00:00:00 Rep. Liz Cheney may be many things, but we are safe in assuming she is not stupid.\n","\n","She must have known that fist bumping President Joe Biden, insisting Democrats are not the “sworn enemies” of Republicans and tweeting in all caps that “anyone who claims” the 2020 election was stolen is “spreading THE BIG LIE,” would cost her a House Republican leadership post and, by 2022, probably her House seat too.\n","\n","Furthermore, as the offspring of the former vice president and ruthless bureaucratic warrior Dick Cheney, another safe assumption is that the congresswoman has an endgame. But what is it?\n","\n","Two days before the fateful fist bump, Liz Cheney was asked by the New York Post if she would ever consider running for president. She responded, “I’m not ruling anything in or out—ever is a long time.”\n","\n","If her plan is to run for president in 2024, we may want to reconsider the assumption that she is not stupid. All available data suggests the path for an anti-Trump politician in today’s Republican Party is imaginary.\n","\n","Trump holds an 88 percent approval rating among Republican voters, according to an in-depth party analysis conducted in March by the Republican polling firm Fabrizio, Lee and Associates. Some 57 percent believe Trump should remain party leader. The same number would vote for him a presidential primary “no matter what.” Only 16 percent of Republicans would definitely vote for somebody else.\n","\n","Cheney’s refusal to accept “The Big Lie” puts her squarely in the party minority. An April CNN poll determined that 70 percent of Republican voters believe “Biden did not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency,” while an April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60 percent of Republicans think the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. There’s a reason why House Republicans are not interested in expending their political capital to defend her.\n","\n","Besides, we’ve already seen people try to run against Trump in a presidential primary, and it wasn’t pretty. Try to think of Trump’s 2020 primary rivals without emulating Rick Perry’s most infamous moment (“Let’s see. What’s the third one there? … Oops!”).\n","\n","Perhaps Cheney is interested in leading the nascent third-party effort being organized (or, to be more precise, threatened) by Miles Taylor, the former Trump administration official-turned-Trump-critic who wrote that anonymous book about Trump. Such a move would not be worthy of a political chessmaster. Cheney must know that most third-party efforts crash and burn. And those involved, according to the New York Times, appear to largely be Republicans who don’t hold current office and had already effectively purged themselves from the party. Such a group is more likely to shrink the Democrats’ big tent by depriving them of the right-leaning “Never Trump” vote, than becoming a major force of its own. While Cheney may not be concerned about the electoral prospects of Democrats, presumably she isn’t going through all this trouble just to splinter the Democratic vote and help Trumpian Republicans—possibly including Trump himself—regain power.\n","\n","So what could Liz Cheney be thinking? I suspect the answer lies in the last five words of her statement to the New York Post: “ever is a long time.” The endgame is not winning in 2024, but winning control of the party after 2024.\n","\n","Liz Cheney is the daughter of a man who served in high-ranking posts under Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. Surely she knows that parties are buffeted by events and change over time. And if events prompt the GOP to eventually turn away from Trump, the Republican who made the most prominent break with Trump would be uniquely positioned to lead the party.\n","\n","Yes, the Trumpification of the Republican Party was brewing for a long time, going all the way back to the Nixon-era Southern Strategy. But let’s not forget: Just nine years ago, the party’s standard-bearer was Mitt Romney.\n","\n","Today’s Republican Party is little more than a cult of personality. But how long can a cult of personality sustain, especially when the personality at the top is so widely unpopular? Last month’s NBC News poll pegged Trump’s favorability at 32 percent. (Even if Trump tends to underpoll by a few points because his supporters are less likely to participate in polls, that is an abysmal number.)\n","\n","Parties can only lose so much before its rank-and-file members conclude, “the problem isn’t you, it’s me.” The experience of the Democrats in the 1980s and 1990s suggests a rule-of-three. To be beaten twice by Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 could be excused by his unique charm. To beaten by charismatic Reagan and the awkward George H. W. Bush in 1988 convinced Democrats that they had their own internal problems to solve. So in 1992, exasperated primary voters were prepared to accept a moderate who breaks with liberal orthodoxy on welfare, the death penalty and the overall scope of government, and Bill Clinton met that moment.\n","\n","Following other losing streaks in history, parties sought presidential nominees who could turn the page on their pasts. After losing five consecutive presidential elections to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman over the course of the Great Depression and World War II, Republicans embraced the war hero Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and reversed their fortunes with a nominee who had little interest on overturning the New Deal. Around the turn of the 20th century, Democrats lost the presidency twice in a row with the agrarian populist William Jennings Bryan, then tried the conservative Alton Parker and still lost, then lost again with Bryan, before finally succeeding in 1912 with the urbane progressive Woodrow Wilson.\n","\n","Trump’s 2016 victory staved off a rule-of-three moment of reckoning for Republicans. But since then, Republicans have lost both chambers of Congress and the presidency. What if Republicans fail to take back Congress in the 2022 midterms? Then whiff in the 2024 presidential election? That would be a lot of losing to swallow. Would Republicans still let an unpopular Trump function as their de facto party boss? Maybe the cultish grip Trump has on Republicans is so tight, they don’t care if they lose. Or, they will keep storming the Capitol and denying reality after every defeat. However, history suggests losing parties eventually adapt to reality, for their own survival.\n","\n","When the GOP is ready for reality, Cheney will be ready and waiting, because her defiant rejection of The Big Lie gives her the cleanest of breaks from Trump. Her actions are in stark contrast to former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie. He too has tried to distance himself from the insurrection. But he also said this month that he would give Trump an “overall” grade of “A.” Christie is straining to maintain some credibility with the party’s mainstream while also appealing to the anti-Trump minority. Cheney isn’t trying to blur any lines, and that may be to her benefit down the line.\n","\n","The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer believes Cheney doesn’t deserve to be cleansed of Trump’s sins. Last week, he made the case that Cheney is not the antithesis of Trump, but the precursor, as she helped “build” the GOP “monster” over which Trump now presides. His case rests on Cheney’s scurrilous attacks against Obama-era Democrats for being soft of terrorism. Cheney “insisted that the president was secretly sympathetic to jihadists” and “launched a McCarthyite crusade against seven unnamed attorneys in the Obama-era Justice Department who had previously represented terrorism suspects.”\n","\n","Serwer concludes that Cheney’s demagoguery and demonization “is the logic of the War on Terror, and also the logic of the party of Trump.” But drawing that connection between Cheney and Trump skips past the party’s ideological shift on foreign policy that widely separates the two.\n","\n","Cheney is an old-fashioned conservative hawk who wants to treat Russia as an adversary. Trump is a quasi-isolationist promoter of “America First.” Cheney openly criticized Trump’s embrace of Putin. Last month, the pro-Trump website The Federalist charged Cheney with using reports of Russian bounties against American soldiers in Afghanistan—reports now treated by U.S. intelligence with “low to moderate confidence”—to “undermine Trump.”\n","\n","The intra-party foreign policy divide is acutely relevant to understanding what’s driving Cheney’s actions. She was always uncomfortable with the direction Trump was taking the party internationally, and she wants to return the GOP to its late 20th century hawkish roots. Unless Biden takes an unexpected hawkish turn, expect Cheney to use her augmented media platform to swipe at Biden’s foreign policy in equal measure as she swipes at Trump’s mendacity.\n","\n","This is why Democrats can’t get more excited about Cheney’s principled revolt; she is grounded in principles Democrats don’t share. In recent weeks she has argued against rejoining the Iran nuclear deal and against withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. Of course, Trump agreed with her on the Iran nuclear deal; his foreign policy vision was an ideologically inconsistent mix of “America First” isolationism and knee-jerk opposition to whatever Barack Obama did. But Cheney’s foreign policy views are deeply held and aggressively waged. She is unlikely to join with Democrats to stop Trumpism. She wants to unite her fellow hawks to stop Democrats and Trumpism.\n","\n","But she must know she is in no position at present to lead an ideological army to win control of the GOP, let alone the White House. All she can do now is plant her flag, own her turf and wait until the moment is hers to seize—most likely after 2024.\n","['More Claire Kelloway'] 2019-01-14 02:06:42+00:00 The midterm elections made two things very clear about Democratic voters in the Donald Trump era. First, they vastly outnumber Republican voters: Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives and won the popular vote by more than eight percentage points, the biggest midterm “blue wave” since Watergate. But, second, those Democratic supporters are geographically clustered in a way that wastes millions of their votes. While the party improved its margins among rural voters compared to 2016, its candidates still lost by a whopping fourteen to eighteen percentage points outside of metro areas, lagging well behind Barack Obama’s 2012 performance. As a result, Democrats lost two net Senate seats. The Senate map in 2020 is only slightly less foreboding, as statewide races in heavily rural states like Iowa, Missouri, and the Dakotas seem to slip ever further out of reach.\n","\n","There was a time in the very recent past when many on the left were confident that an era of Democratic dominance was just around the corner, the inevitable result of a “rising electorate” of younger, better educated, and more diverse voters. The midterms were a wake-up call. The rising electorate may be swinging left, but there has been an equal reaction among older and less educated whites—and they represent a lot more of the political map. Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.\n","\n","Mindful of this reality, many Democratic strategists are rightly warning that the party desperately needs a strategy to win back rural voters. Unfortunately, the most prominent plans tend to combine small-bore ideas that are insufficient to the scale of the problem (like more money for rural broadband) with attacks on Trump’s agricultural tariffs, which Trump-supporting farmers actually tend to give the president a pass on.\n","\n","While the notion that all Trump voters are motivated by “economic anxiety” has been thoroughly debunked, there’s no denying that America’s agricultural communities have been starkly declining for years-struggling to turn profits through farming, suffering epidemic levels of opioid addiction and suicide. Democrats thus have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to try to win these voters back by offering policies that will improve their livelihoods in a way that stoking white cultural grievance never will.\n","\n","Just ask J. D. Scholten. The thirty-eight-year-old former minor league baseball player garnered national attention in November for almost unseating Iowa Representative Steve King, an eight-term Republican incumbent in one of the reddest districts in America—and perhaps the most unabashed racist in Congress. The last Democrat to run against King lost by 22.6 percent; in 2016, the district went for Trump by twenty-seven points. Yet Scholten lost by only 3.4 percentage points—a swing from 2016 that, if it could be replicated nationally, would all but wipe out the current incarnation of the Republican Party. How did he do it?\n","\n","“I have a lot of folks calling me thinking of running for president and they want to know what their rural message should be,” Scholten says. His answer: “Talk about market consolidation.”\n","\n","Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.\n","\n","At his thirty-nine town hall meetings, across every county in Iowa’s Fourth District, Scholten spoke about improving the economy by addressing the growing power of agribusiness monopolies, which, by raising prices on what farmers buy and pushing down prices of what farmers sell, are devastating farm incomes. “Agriculture is the backbone of this district,” Scholten says. “At every [town hall] I talked about how farmers are being squeezed on the input and on the output side. . . . That resonated more than tariffs ever did, and I think that’s one thing that national reporters never understood.\n","\n","“I think farmers view tariffs as temporary, whereas market consolidation is a long-term issue,” he adds, noting that the call for fair competition has bipartisan appeal. “Anti-trust . . . has not been a partisan issue. Traditional Republicans, they want competitive markets, and that goes against what’s happening in the ag business.”\n","\n","Scholten’s message on agribusiness monopolies may have resonated with farmers, but it has not yet broken through with big-city liberals, too many of whom write off the possibility that progressive economic populism could appeal to rural voters more than right-wing cultural warfare. Until Democratic leaders and candidates find their voice on the key issue affecting rural communities’ economic fortunes, even the biggest blue wave won’t be enough to take back the map.\n","\n","If you have heard about the plight of America’s farmers, it was likely in the context of Trump’s media vortex. You may have seen stories about dairy farms closing because Trump made a fuss about Canadian dairy markets while renegotiating NAFTA. Or you know that China aimed retaliatory tariffs at farmers to target Trump’s base. But while Trump’s trade policies have certainly made matters worse for many farmers, they are hardly the prime cause for the full-blown crisis gripping America’s farm economy. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. The three years leading up to the 2016 election saw the sharpest decline in farm incomes since the Great Depression. In 2015, more than half of all farm households lost more money than they made farming.\n","\n","By now, many observers are predicting that we are on the verge of a farm crisis more dangerous than the one that ripped rural America apart in the 1980s. The downturn is particularly devastating for grain and dairy farmers, who rely on large annual operating loans to keep going each season. After four to five years of losing money on every acre of grain or gallon of milk, these farms have exhausted their credit lines. Farmers’ debt-to-income ratios are the highest they’ve been in three decades. Wisconsin alone has lost 1,100 dairy farms over the past two years. One large dairy co-op in the Northeast sent its members a list of suicide and mental-health hotlines along with their dairy checks.\n","\n","As farm income declines, so do whole regions. First, local equipment dealers and seed and feed suppliers close. Then, with the decline in economic activity and eventual loss of population, so do local banks, schools, and hospitals. Most people in rural America are not farmers, but in traditionally ag-dependent regions, even non-farmers’ livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on farm income, which is often the only substantial source of incoming wealth.\n","\n","What is behind the accelerating decline? One popular idea in elite quarters is that the plight of rural America was foreordained by technological change. As agriculture becomes more productive, the thinking goes, we need fewer farmers, and so rural communities naturally depopulate. Meanwhile, a digitized, global economy naturally gives the highest reward to highly skilled “knowledge workers” who feed off each other’s creativity by clustering in elite cities. That’s the theme of a recent report by the Brookings Institution, revealingly entitled “Strategies for Left-Behind Places.” It concludes that the growing gap between elite cities and rural America is the inevitable result of digital technology, which has “increasingly rewarded the most talent-laden clusters of skills and firms.”\n","\n","That’s a narrative that appeals to many experts, who not coincidentally live in those “talent-laden clusters.” It suggests that the plight of Left-Behind Places is nobody’s fault—it’s the result of an impersonal evolutionary process that just happens to favor coastal elites while crushing the maladapted.\n","\n","Well, here’s a different take—one that has far more resonance in heartland America and is backed up by overwhelming evidence. The biggest cause of growing regional inequality isn’t technology; it’s changes in public policy, embraced by both parties, that have enabled predatory monopolies to strip wealth away from farmers and rural communities and transfer it to America’s snazziest zip codes.\n","\n","Here’s how it works. Farmers are caught between monopolized sellers and buyers. They must pay ever higher prices to the giants who dominate the market for the supplies they need, like seed and fertilizer. At the same time, they must accept ever lower prices from the giant agribusinesses that buy the stuff they sell, like crops and livestock.\n","\n","Start with how corporate concentration affects the prices farmers pay. In 1994, the top four seed companies controlled only 21 percent of the global seed market. By 2013, just the top three controlled 55 percent, with Monsanto alone controlling more than a quarter. With that increase in concentration has come a shocking increase in the cost of seed, because these giants face little pressure to compete on price. USDA data shows that the per-acre cost of soybean and corn seed spiked dramatically between 1995 and 2014, by 351 percent and 321 percent, respectively.\n","\n","Today’s seeds are often genetically modified to produce higher yields, but that doesn’t translate into more net income for the farmers. Not only is the cost of genetically modified seed high, but patent monopolies often make it illegal for farmers to use a portion of their crops to produce their own seeds, as most did in the past. Moreover, even as farmers are paying monopoly prices for a diminishing selection of seed strains produced by handful of giant corporations, they also are paying monopoly prices for fertilizers and pesticides, often to the same corporations. Since 2017, the Big Six seed and agrichemical companies have shrunk to four, after Dow merged with DuPont and Bayer purchased Monsanto. The top four producers of nitrogen fertilizer controlled 34 percent of the market in 1977, but by 2015 had increased their share to more than two-thirds.\n","\n","As crop prices fall and farmers look for areas to cut back on the cost of inputs, many feel up against a wall. “[Seed companies] figure out, how much will a farmer actually pay for seed corn before he’ll go switch to some other company,” says Nebraska farmer Vern Jantzen. “If I don’t like what Mycogen is charging for seed corn I can go to Pioneer and I can go to Dekalb, but there’s only three guys. If they all kind of talk to each other a little bit, there isn’t a whole lot of difference in prices.” That is, of course, when there are even multiple sellers to choose from.\n","\n","The same story holds for chemicals used in agriculture, whose prices roughly tripled from 1990 to today, with the steepest increases after 2007. The fertilizer market is dominated by several international phosphorous and potash cartels, and a 2013 monograph by the American Antitrust Institute made the case that price swings in these markets were due to oligopolistic behavior.\n","\n","Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. While Trump’s trade policies have certainly made matters worse, they are hardly the prime cause.\n","\n","All together, the average farmer spends three times more on inputs per acre today than in the 1990s. Recently, the president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, John Hansen, looked up the corn prices from 1973, when he started farming. At that time, he sold corn for $3.30 a bushel; in 2017 the average price per bushel was $3.33. “So, how does it work to live and farm in 2017 and pay for those 2017 costs with 1973 prices?” Hansen asked in a message to NFU members. “The honest answer is that it does not work.”\n","\n","It does work, though, for the seed and chemical companies. Before their acquisition by Bayer and recent legal trouble, Monsanto touted record seed sales and profits in 2017. “They’ve had a boom while farmers have gone broke,” says Joe Maxwell, who is a farmer, former lieutenant governor of Missouri, and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets.\n","\n","Even as monopolization means that farmers pay more for the supplies they need, it also means that they receive less for the food they produce.\n","\n","Nationally, the top four beef packers slaughtered 25 percent of cows in 1977; today that’s up to 84 percent. As recently as 1990, four companies processed 61 percent of all soybeans; today those same four process 85 percent. These statistics actually understate the problem, because at the local level, dominant agribusinesses often have total monopolies. “Today you’ll find that in most all this country, really, there’s just one buyer,” says Maxwell. “It’s as if they all sat in a room somewhere and carved the country up.”\n","\n","Credit: Courtesy J. D. Scholten for Congress\n","\n","This degree of corporate concentration has turned farmers into price takers. If there’s a single statistic that captures the plight of rural America, it is this: In the 1980s, when American consumers spent a dollar on food, 37 cents out of that dollar went back to the farmer. Today, farmers receive less than 15 cents on every dollar. The difference is increasingly flowing to powerful and concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. In 2016, the big meat-packer Smithfield openly bragged about how its record profits were due to a fourteen-year low in the prices paid to hog farmers and simultaneously higher consumer prices for packaged pork products.\n","\n","The same story repeats across agricultural sectors, from grains and produce to eggs and poultry. The Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginias says its chicken farmer members haven’t seen an increase in base pay for the past twenty years. Nor do consumers benefit. Chicken and turkey retail prices grew steadily over the last decade, by 19 percent and 47 percent from 2007 to 2013, respectively, before finally slowing and then slightly declining over the past three years.\n","\n","As Big Ag cuts farmers’ margins, often the only way farmers can see to stay in business is to try making it up on volume. This is what accounts for the emergence of “confined animal feeding operations,” or CAFOs, in which thousands of animals are crammed together in inhumane conditions. CAFOs reflect the ruinous competition farmers face with one another. They also pose a massive threat to human health, as some farmers routinely use nontherapeutic antibiotics on animals crowded into confined spaces, producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And they cause vile pollution from large manure lagoons, further detracting from the quality of life across expanding sections of rural America.\n","\n","When Barack Obama was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, he seemed to understand the role that corporate concentration was playing in immiserating much of rural America. Campaigning in Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado, he promised to take on abuses by monopolistic agribusinesses, particularly meat-packers.\n","\n","Early in his presidency, he followed up on these promises by having top Agriculture Department (USDA) and Justice Department officials hold hearings across the country to investigate malpractice in the poultry, cattle, dairy, and seed industries, as well as the growing gap between the prices consumers paid and farmers received. At the conclusion of these hearings the USDA proposed rule changes that would have given farmers far greater power to stand up to abuses by ag monopolies.\n","\n","But the blowback was immediate. Big Meat threw its lobbying weight behind an effort to block the reforms. Soon, sixty-eight Republicans and forty-seven Democrats delivered a letter to the USDA saying that the new rules were unjustified and required more industry input and economic analysis. Obama could have implemented the rules unilaterally, but for whatever reason his secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, hesitated. Then, in 2010, Republicans took the House and began passing appropriations riders that stripped the USDA of the necessary funds to implement the rules even if they had gone into effect. In December 2016, Vilsack finally signed off on a significantly watered-down rule change. But shortly after President Trump took office, new Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue shot down even these modest reforms and dissolved the USDA’s antitrust agency entirely, burying its duties within the agribusiness-friendly Agricultural Marketing Service agency.\n","\n","So it turns out that the Democrats briefly did have a rural policy that took monopoly seriously, but gave it low priority and retreated in the face of corporate opposition. Today, this record leaves many farmers bitter, especially those who risked retaliation by testifying at the USDA hearings about the abuses they suffered at the hands of monopolists. That bitterness is only amplified when they hear voices in the Democratic Party arguing for solutions that fail to acknowledge the party’s own role in fostering agribusiness monopolies. Writing in the New York Times shortly after the election, columnist Michael Tomasky recommended that the party embrace a “four pillar” plan written by Tom Vilsack, which calls for, among other things, spending more money on opioid addiction treatment, encouraging more local farmers’ markets, and directing more payments to farmers who set aside land for conservation. But Vilsack’s plan pointedly fails to mention a central cause of American farmers’ misery, let alone any strategies for taking on the agribusiness monopolies he failed to roll back during his time in office. Perhaps not coincidentally, Vilsack is currently the president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, an agribusiness lobbying group.\n","\n","Other plans circulating in Democratic quarters embrace a kind of social Darwinism to explain the growth of regional inequality and then propose solutions that are almost insulting in their inadequacy and implicit victim blaming. Brookings Institution’s “Strategies for Left-Behind Places,” for example, states flatly that it would be “inefficient to ‘save’ every left-behind small city or rural community in the U.S.” It then argues that the best that can be done is to offer displaced farmers and rural workers more broadband networks, some targeted federal economic development programs, and training in programming skills. The report concludes by calling for changes to zoning laws that would produce more affordable housing in high-cost cities like New York and San Francisco, thereby allowing more heartlanders to move to those thriving metropolises—a solution that would, of course, only exacerbate the problem of coastal population clustering. Though the report does mention rising monopoly as a cause of regional inequality, it stops short of recommending anti-monopoly measures as part of the solution.\n","\n","Big Ag would obviously oppose any Democratic effort to win in rural America with an anti-monopoly playbook. But policy levers, large and small, are available at every level of government to politicians who want to show their solidarity with ordinary voters in rural communities. The big policy levers include things like busting up ag monopolies and reforming giant food co-ops. An encouraging start is a pair of complementary bills, introduced by Senator Cory Booker and Representative Mark Pocan, both Democrats, that would put an eighteen-month moratorium on large agribusiness mergers while a new commission studies ways to improve competition policy enforcement. (For more details, see “The Three Ways Democrats Can Fix the Farm Economy” by Adam Diamond.)\n","\n","Smaller-scale but still substantive measures include legislation that would prevent meat-packers from vertically integrating into owning livestock or forcing farmers into exploitative contracts. Booker and Republican Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would have addressed agricultural monopoly in still another way, by reforming so-called “checkoff” programs. These are federally sponsored programs that collect money from farmers to market their product but that often wind up financing agribusiness lobbying groups (The amendment failed, but did draw thirty-eight votes from across both parties.) At the local level, mandating that schools use more locally grown food in their cafeterias is one available weapon for combating agribusiness monopoly.\n","\n","In the 1980s, when American consumers spent a dollar on food, 37 cents went back to the farmer. Today, it’s less than 15 cents. The difference is increasingly flowing to concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers.\n","\n","Advocating for such policies could appeal to a far broader set of Americans than just farmers. One reason is that monopolization in agriculture has by now become so extreme that even as it drives down prices for farmers, it can also drive up prices for consumers. This reality has been reinforced by recent investigations into price fixing at tuna companies, mega-brewers, dairy co-ops, chicken processors, and pork packers. Monopolization also affects urban and suburban consumers by forcing farmers into a system of industrial-scale monoculture that lacks resiliency in the face of climate change, poses substantial human health and environmental threats, and produces a level of cruelty to animals that more and more Americans can no longer abide. Though rural and urban Americans may differ on many cultural wedge issues, their common victimization by monopolists provides an issue that bridges the divide.\n","\n","Taking on agribusiness monopolies also provides a way to do something important for farm and food chain workers exploited under the current system. Many of the people who pick our food and cut our meats, whether they are undocumented immigrants, refugees, people of color, or working-class whites, are further marginalized when a single agricultural giant controls all the jobs available to them across whole regions.\n","\n","Rural communities are also deeply oppressed by other forms of monopoly. These include the closing of local hospitals bought out by giant corporate chains; the takeover of locally owned financial institutions by taxpayer-subsidized “too big to fail” banks; the loss of connectivity to the global economy that results when airlines cut off service to “flyover country”; and the threats posed by deregulated freight railroad monopolies that are abandoning service to farms and industries along branch lines while charging monopoly prices on the mainline traffic they keep.\n","\n","J. D. Scholten also points to how large chain stores like Dollar General “sink money out of the community” by shutting down locally owned retailers. Restoring antitrust enforcement across the board, including against companies like Walmart and Amazon, would go a long way toward allowing local economies to once again compete on an even playing field. “Part of that rural identity is being independent,” argues Scholten. “Now [rural communities] are reliant on a corporation rather than being self-employed, and I think that’s part of the issue.”\n","\n","In the face of such challenges and opportunities, leaders interested in addressing the nation’s growing economic and political divides should stop listening to people who think we can fix the problems of rural America with more broadband, coding classes, and zoning changes. Instead they should pay attention to people like Scholten who know what they are talking about and are willing to say it out loud.\n","['More Nancy Letourneau'] 2019-02-27 00:00:00 One of the biggest stories coming out of the 2018 midterms was about the election fraud that occurred in North Carolina. Mark Harris, the Republican candidate in the 9th congressional district, hired political operative Leslie McCrae Dowless against the advice of several people, including his own son. Dowless collected absentee ballots from voters and if they registered a vote for the Democrat in the race, he either threw them away or changed the vote. After Harris narrowly won, the fraud was uncovered and a new election ordered to take place.\n","\n","But leave it up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to blame it all on Democrats.\n","\n","The big lie the Majority Leader tells is to equate what happened in North Carolina with voter fraud. He says that, “a very real incident of voter fraud has become national news.” The lesson Mitch McConnell wants us to take from the election in North Carolina’s 9th congressional district is that voter fraud is very real and Democrats are to blame for failing to support Republican efforts to combat it.\n","\n","What McConnell doesn’t want you to know is that North Carolina already has a voter ID law—and it didn’t stop the “wrongdoing” he’s talking about. That’s because what Dowless did was not voter fraud—it was election fraud and voters had nothing to do with it.\n","\n","It is interesting to think about why McConnell would bother to come up with such a mendacious account of what happened in North Carolina. It didn’t involve a senate seat and, contrary to what he suggested in that floor speech, it is Republicans who have gone silent when it comes to their constant refrains about voter fraud.\n","\n","I would suggest that the Majority Leader made that speech on Tuesday for the same reason that he took the time to write an equally mendacious ope-ed about a bill Democrats plan to vote on in the House next week. It is being referred to as either HR 1 or the “For the People Act” and contains measures to restore voting rights, as well as legislative changes to address gerrymandering, campaign finance and ethics reform.\n","\n","McConnell is concerned because, more than anyone else, he has demonstrated over and over again that he understands what Zachary Roth wrote two years ago.\n","\n","Today’s conservatives have no such confidence that the people are on their side. In fact, they are beginning to perceive that they’re in the minority – perhaps more glaringly than ever before. And yet this realization has brought with it another more hopeful one: being outnumbered doesn’t have to mean losing.\n","\n","The Majority Leader knows that Republicans are in the minority and the only way to maintain his power is to undermine democracy by any means at his disposal. Of course he can’t admit to that. So instead, he suggests that a case of Republican election fraud is the fault of Democrats for not believing the lies his party tells about voter fraud in order to suppress the vote.\n","\n","I’d probably give McConnell the benefit of the doubt in not being as ignorant as Donald Trump. But he has proven once again that he is every bit as mendacious as the president.\n","['More Garrett Epps'] 2020-10-27 00:00:00 Two weeks before Election Day, the U.S. Supreme Court, by a tie vote, affirmed a pro-voting rights decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Drawing on the state’s constitution, the Pennsylvania court ordered the state to count mail ballots mailed by November 3 and received within three days after that date. The state’s constitution protects voting rights far more strongly than the U.S. Constitution, the majority said, and thus required adjustments for the chaotic combination of a pandemic and a sluggish if not sabotaged postal system.\n","\n","That ruling was a small victory both for the right to vote and for the authority of state courts. That victory may be short-lived. In an order issued Monday, the Supreme Court ruled, 5-3, against allowing the same kind of extended deadline in Wisconsin. The difference? The lower-court order that the Supreme Court crushed was issued by a federal, not a state court. That was apparently dispositive to Chief Justice John Roberts, who had voted against staying the Pennsylvania court.\n","\n","The defeat for Wisconsin voters is likely final. But the victory for Pennsylvanians is not.\n","\n","Last Friday, the Republican Party and its leaders were back at the Supreme Court, asking the Court to examine the ballot-deadline and strike it down. There are two reasons for concern about Pennsylvania’s second bite at the apple. The first is that (as I wrote last week), the Pennsylvania Republicans’ arguments are both outlandish and dangerous. But, on the evidence of the Wisconsin case, that hasn’t stopped at least one Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, from embracing them. His concurrence in Democratic National Committee v. Wisconsin State Legislature endorses the Republicans’ far-right notion that state courts, interpreting state statutes in light of state constitutions, are nonetheless subject to being overruled by federal courts who disagree with their reading of state law. Indeed, the argument is more extreme than that. State legislatures (of necessity run by partisan majorities) have sole authority over all aspects of federal elections, the argument runs. State legislatures pass the statutes, but state courts have no jurisdiction to interpret them or examine them by the light of their state constitutions.\n","\n","Kavanaugh’s opinion is drawn from the opinion of the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist in Bush v. Gore. The re-emergence of that cursed travesty is particularly ominous in October 2020. That’s because, unless the election on Nov. 3 produces a Democratic landslide, Republican lawyers will ask federal courts to shut down the counting of ballots they deem illegitimate. The stage is set for Bush v. Gore: The Sequel.\n","\n","More ominously still, the 4-4 Court that allowed the late-ballot deadline in Pennsylvania is no more. On Monday night, in a ceremony with all the elegance and solemnity of a late-night wedding at the Little Neon Chapel in Las Vegas, Amy Coney Barrett was sworn in an associate justice of the Supreme Court, filling the ninth seat, left empty by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n","\n","As the Court has changed, so has the Pennsylvania case. Earlier this month, the Republican plaintiffs were asking the Supreme Court to step into the case before hearing it. That is, they wanted an emergency stay of the state court order even before the Justices could consider whether to hear the case. Now they are back asking the Court to hear it and to decide it without argument—which could mean a decision this week. But if the Court refuses that, they’ve asked for an order to “segregate” ballots that arrive by Election Day from those that arrive after it.\n","\n","That, in effect, would freeze the count in Pennsylvania until the new nine-justice court can decide the issue—perhaps after emergency Bush v. Gore-style oral arguments. And if that happens, it is possible that the entire nationwide presidential election will turn on Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes. The Justices will decide the case knowing full well that, for the second time in 20 years, they will be picking the president of their choice.\n","\n","Chief Justice John Roberts (no friend of voting rights) had voted to allow the Pennsylvania extension to take effect. However, he voted with the majority to shut down the Wisconsin ballot extension. He wrote separately to make clear his commitment to the authority of state courts. The Wisconsin appeal was from an order of a federal district court, he noted. However, “the Pennsylvania applications implicated the authority of state courts to apply their own constitutions,” while “this case involves federal intrusion on state lawmaking processes.” That question involves “[d]ifferent bodies of law and different precedents.”\n","\n","In other words, Roberts’s vote may be at least up for grabs.\n","\n","But, John Roberts, meet 2020. There are nine justices now. The Chief’s days as the “swing Justice” are past, and all eyes are on Justice Barrett. She would not promise to recuse from cases involving the man by whose side she stood as recently as Monday night.\n","\n","Former Fourth Circuit Judge J. Michael Luttig—as hard-right a conservative jurist as I have ever met—warned in The Washington Post on October 17 that the Supreme Court’s own caselaw suggested that her recusal was required. But recusal in the abstract is one thing. If the White House hangs in the balance, she may remember that she refused to promise anything of the sort during her confirmation.\n","\n","In the past four weeks, many people wondered how it is that Barrett, claiming virtue, has been willing to wade into this tawdry banana-republic charade; we may learn the truth about Barrett’s character much sooner than expected.\n","['More Nancy Letourneau'] 2020-11-16 00:00:00 During Donald Trump’s presidency, the hardest-working journalists have been those who focus on fact-checking. Keeping up with a president who averaged almost 50 false or misleading statements a day during the final weeks of the 2020 campaign has been challenging.\n","\n","But all lies are not the same. It’s one thing to lie about the size of a campaign rally and a different thing for the president to spread false information during a pandemic or undermine democracy with lies about a rigged election. That is why, back in June, Twitter started labeling Trump’s lies about mail-in ballots as misinformation. The president’s enablers’ response was to cry “censorship” and go in search of social media platforms that allowed the spread of disinformation without any warning labels.\n","\n","Waiting in the wings was Parler, which had been built as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook in 2018 by John Matze and Jared Thompson. Financing for the venture came from Rebekah Mercer, who, along with her father, hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, has been a major donor to conservative causes, including Breitbart News. In June, Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and author who made a name for himself trafficking in pro-Trump conspiracy theories, announced that he had taken an ownership stake in Parler, as has Jeffrey Wernick, bitcoin investor and advocate.\n","\n","Following a spike in membership last June, Parler experienced a second wave of interest when Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 election, and Twitter once again labeled the president’s obsessive tweets about voter fraud as misinformation. Almost immediately, the Parler app went from 200,000 downloads in October to 2 million on November 8th, according to Matze.\n","\n","Some of Parler’s most active users include Fox News host Sean Hannity, radio personality and attorney Mark Levin, far-right activist Laura Loomer, Senator Ted Cruz, and Congressman Devin Nunes. Eric Trump and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign have accounts on the platform. According to an ADL report released Thursday, members of the Proud Boys, QAnoners, anti-government extremists, and white supremacists all openly promote their views on Parler. “Holocaust denial, antisemitism, racism, and other forms of bigotry are also easy to find,” the ADL said.\n","\n","Describing himself as a devotee of libertarians like Thomas Sowell and Ayn Rand, Matze suggests that on his social media platform, “There are going to be no fact checkers. You’re not going to be told what to think and what to say. A police officer isn’t going to arrest you if you say the wrong opinion.” That statement gets to the heart of the issue by claiming that fact-checkers are policing opinions. Right-wing author Candace Owens, a Parler supporter, recently did the same thing during a rant she posted on YouTube announcing that she was suing Facebook over their fact-checkers decision to delete a post of hers that spread disinformation about coronavirus. She claimed that when the fact-checkers decide that they don’t want to hear your opinion, you’re censored.\n","\n","The equation of facts and opinions is reminiscent of what Matthew Sheffield wrote about his exodus from right-wing news.\n","\n","U.S. conservatives do not understand the purpose of journalism. This became evident to me as I saw that conservative-dominated media outlets were MUCH more biased than outlets run by liberals. I eventually realized that most people who run right-dominated media outlets see it as their DUTY to be unfair and to favor Republicans because doing so would somehow counteract perceived liberal bias… I also discovered, as I rose through the right-wing media ranks, that most conservative media figures have no journalism training or desire to fact-check their own side. I also saw so many people think that reporting of info negative to GOP politicians was biased, even if it was true.\n","\n","Right-wing media’s goal is to deny the existence of facts and convince their readers/viewers that everything boils down to partisan differences. Therefore, when fact-checkers label something as false, Trump’s enablers assume it is an expression of liberal bias in an attempt to censor their opinions. Social media sites like Parler exist to allow disinformation to flow freely, protected within an epistemic bubble.\n","\n","In that world, the truth is meaningless. As Peter Pomerantsev warned about Vladimir Putin’s propaganda efforts: “insisting on the lie, the Kremlin intimidates others by showing that it is in control of defining ‘reality.’ This is why it’s so important for Moscow to do away with the truth. If nothing is true, then anything is possible.” In this country, if nothing is true, the loser of a presidential election can claim that it was rigged and prevent a peaceful transition of power.\n","\n","While we grapple with what that means for our democracy, one thing you can count on is the Washington Monthly. We will not be intimidated into ceding control of reality. Fact-checkers are always welcome on these pages as a means of determining what is true. While we share our opinions, we ground them in facts and are clear about the difference.\n","\n","If that is something you value, please consider making a donation during our year-end fundraising drive.

By Friday afternoon, the president was tweeting that they’d have a new campaign ad on “Sleepy Joe Biden.” Here’s the first one they came up with.\n","\n","They didn’t get the facts all wrong. Biden will raise taxes on the wealthy and has promised a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But the main point was to paint the former vice president as weak and beholden to the far left. That is supposed to scare moms.\n","\n","Things went downhill from there. Here is the ad they released two days later.\n","\n","The three issues from the previous ad were repeated. But this one begins by suggesting that Biden is in his basement alone, hiding, and diminished.\n","\n","The first thing to note is that Biden is doing the same thing a lot of Americans are doing: practicing social distancing to slow the spread of a pandemic. I suspect that a lot of voters identify with him. But secondly, the Trump campaign had to photoshop images of Biden to create some visuals to dramatize their claims.\n","\n","The first image is of Biden at an event outside. It has been photoshopped to look like it was taken in his basement and the microphone in his hand has been edited out.\n","\n","The second one is of Biden attending an event at the home of the mayor of Coralville, Iowa. The vice president apparently gave up his seat to someone else and sat on the floor. According to The Gazette, the original photo was taken by their photographer Liz Martin and the Trump campaign not only edited it to remove the people around Biden, but failed to get permission to use it.\n","\n","The third one was taken by an AP photographer on June 1 when Biden met with community leaders in a Black church in Wilmington, Delaware to discuss the George Floyd protests. The specific image was taken as Biden bowed his head in prayer with the group. It has been used in the ad to make him look alone and dejected.\n","\n","If this is the kind of thing Stepien halted the president’s ad campaign in order to produce, it certainly doesn’t speak well to his skills as a campaign manager. Blatant photoshopping is child’s play, and to misuse an image of the former vice president in prayer is beyond the pale.\n","\n","That is particularly true as the president seems to have simultaneously launched an initiative to suggest that Biden is against the Bible and God. For example, during a “telerally” with Pennsylvania voters on Sunday, Trump said, “Joe Biden, the radical Democrats are against fracking, they’re against guns, and they’re against the Bible, essentially, they’re against God.” Here is what he said in Ohio on Thursday.\n","\n","One can only assume that Trump thinks that kind of thing works with the Christian nationalists. He’s probably right, but they’re already voting for him. Everyone else knows that it’s nothing but an offensive cheap shot.\n","\n","So there you have the Trump campaign’s new attack strategy on Joe Biden: photoshops and lies about the vice president’s faith. But it is hard to simply fault Bill Stepian. When it comes to his candidate, the guy doesn’t have much to work with.\n","['More Martin Longman'] 2019-03-19 00:00:00 In February 2017, Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina’s 7th congressional district introduced the Discouraging Frivolous Lawsuits Act. Devin Nunes is listed as one of the 65 co-sponsors of the bill.\n","\n","Here’s a summary of what the bill would have done if it had been signed into law.\n","\n","This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revise requirements concerning citizen suits. Litigation costs (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) must be awarded to the prevailing party, thus the bill removes a court’s discretion to award the fees. A prevailing party is defined as the party that prevails on more than half of the claims at issue. The bill repeals the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to deny or restrict the use of any area as a disposal site for dredged or fill material when the discharge of those materials would have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas. Current law requires compensatory mitigation to replace the loss of aquatic resource functions in a watershed when a permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters has unavoidable impacts on aquatic resources. This bill prohibits government entities from carrying out compensatory mitigation in excess of existing regulatory requirements.\n","\n","The primary purpose of the bill, aside from poisoning the water supply, is to discourage people from suing polluters by assuring that they’ll get saddled with the defense’s legal fees if they don’t prevail in court. That would assuredly eliminate frivolous suits, but it would also eliminate valid ones by heightening the financial investment and risk tolerance required to initiate them.\n","\n","In any case, Devin Nunes co-sponsored this bill because he likes getting financial support from polluters and he wanted to sound tough on frivolous law suits for the “tort reform” fanatics. Rep. Rice’s proposed bill went nowhere. It was referred to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment where it died. The polluters and right-wing legal lobbyists approvingly noted who co-sponsored it, and that’s about all the impact it had.\n","\n","But Devin Nunes apparently likes frivolous law suits because he just filed one.\n","\n","Stung by obscene and pointed criticism, Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican from California, has sued Twitter and three users for defamation, claiming the users smeared him and the platform allowed it to happen because of a political agenda. The complaint, which was filed in Henrico County Circuit Court in Virginia on Tuesday, seeks $250 million in damages. In making his case, Mr. Nunes, a loyal ally of President Trump and the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, repeated several common Republican complaints that Twitter has repeatedly denied: that it censors Republicans, “shadow bans” their accounts and actively helps their opponents. Though absorbing criticism comes with the territory for politicians, the complaint described the objectionable tweets from the three users as something “that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life.” To make his case, he cited a wide variety of tweets that included accusations of criminal misconduct, crude jokes at his expense and relatively banal criticism. The complaint says the tweets “falsely stated” that Mr. Nunes had brought “shame” to his family and that he was voted “Most Likely to Commit Treason” in high school, and that one of them included a cartoon image of a sexual act with Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The complaint lists dozens of other tweets he found insulting.\n","\n","There is zero chance that a public figure like Congressman Devin Nunes will prevail in court. But I don’t think he can complain if we insist that he pays all the defendants’ legal costs when he loses his case. After all, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?\n","['More Eric Cortellessa'] 2019-04-13 00:00:00 Benjamin Netanyahu has always pandered to Israel’s darkest forces when it suits his purposes. Before the 2015 election, he warned that Arab-Israeli citizens were “voting in droves,” accused his opposition of being manipulated by the Americans, and said a Palestinian state would never emerge on his watch. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s election, in which he defeated Benny Gantz, Netanyahu demonstrated that he will go to any extreme to protect his grip on power. He vowed to annex the West Bank settlements, which, if implemented, this would kill any viable hope for an eventual two-state solution.\n","\n","But his annexation pledge cannot be dismissed as another election-eve attempt to turn out right-wing voters. There’s a major difference between 2015 and 2019. Donald Trump is now in the White House.\n","\n","In the past, Netanyahu could use American presidents to provide him with the cover necessary to disappoint his base. He could promise something radical, gain right-wing support, and then tell the ultra-nationalist, settler parties in his coalition, “I’d love to do this, but I can’t risk angering Washington.” Those days seem to be over. During a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo refused to say whether the administration would oppose Israel’s unilateral annexation of the West Bank.\n","\n","Indeed, Trump has already done Bibi’s bidding. He’s moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, cut aid to the Palestinians, and pulled the United States out of the Iran deal. Most recently, the president gave Netanyahu an enormous campaign gift—recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights—without getting anything in return. Then, Trump helped Bibi again, designating the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization. Standing idle while Netanyahu annexes the settlements would be Trump’s logical next step.\n","\n","If this plan is carried out, the president’s evangelical base would be delighted, but the damage would be irreversible. Israel cannot control Palestinians in the West Bank forever without suffering profound consequences. By extending Israeli sovereignty to territory that should one day constitute a Palestinian state, Netanyahu will force Israel to give up its commitment to remaining both Jewish and democratic—embroiling the nation even deeper into an existential crisis. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned two years ago that Israel was already on a “slippery slope” toward apartheid.\n","\n","For now, many Israelis don’t seem to care. Netanyahu’s 10-year premiership has outlasted the 2011 Arab Uprisings, the Syrian civil war, two conflicts in Gaza, and the Great Recession. Throughout a period of global tumult, he has kept Israel relatively stable and secure. He has expanded Israel’s diplomatic relations abroad, including with China and India. He has forged quiet relationships with its Sunni Arab neighbors, like Saudi Arabia. And he has overseen Israel’s thriving economy, which enjoys an unemployment rate below 4 percent. This short-term success, however, obfuscates the long-term damage he’s inflicting on the country. Economic prosperity will mean very little if Israel can no longer remain a Jewish democracy.\n","\n","Negotiations are now under way between Netanyahu and smaller right-wing parties as the prime minister looks to form his conservative government. Haaretz has reported that smaller parties are considering a bill that would prohibit a sitting prime minister from being indicted—a priority for Netanyahu, who faces multiple charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. In exchange, he would annex the settlements, including isolated outposts.\n","\n","If Trump lets him, it will divide world Jewry in ways like never before. As Tom Friedman has said, the debate about Israel will shift from “left versus right” to “right versus wrong.” The partisan split on Capitol Hill will only deepen as progressives lose ammunition for why the state is worth supporting. Israel will no longer be seen as an instrument of Jewish self-determination, but of permanent domination over the Palestinians. And once that happens, there will be no turning back. History will regard Netanyahu and Trump as the symbiotic partners who destroyed the liberal Zionist dream.\n","['More Martin Longman'] 2019-04-16 00:00:00 At the Washington Monthly, and here at Political Animal, we’ve written from time to time about the Trump administration’s efforts to defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but none of us has done as comprehensive a job of it as Nicholas Confessore. His new piece in the New York Times Magazine focuses on Mick Mulvaney’s time as the CFPB’s acting director.\n","\n","I often hear liberals wonder aloud how so many low-to-moderate income Americans can support the Republican Party when it is clearly not in their financial interests to do so, and nowhere is that more clear than on the issues surrounding the CFPB. Confessore demonstrates this very ably by doing a deep-dive into the payday lending/short-terms loans industry.\n","\n","In the following excerpt, he explains how the payday loan industry rose in influence and power during the Bush administration by making loans to people who (they hoped) would not be able to pay back the money. The CFPB was the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, who was convinced of its necessity by her research into consumer debt.\n","\n","[Elizabeth] Warren and other consumer advocates argued that payday lenders built their industry on a similar sleight of hand. They marketed themselves as lenders of last resort, offering emergency loans for a broken-down car or an unexpected medical bill. But according to Nick Bourke, a former financial-services consultant who now directs consumer-finance research at the Pew Charitable Trusts, what fed the industry’s growth were not emergency expenses but the increasingly unstable incomes of the working poor. As their hourly wages fluctuated at the whims of workplace-optimization software, payday-loan customers — typically white women earning around $30,000, according to Pew’s research — borrowed to pay their rent or electric bills. The average customer paid $55 in fees to borrow $375, due on their next payday. But most found that they couldn’t afford to repay the loan after two weeks. They took out another loan to cover the first, and usually another. Consumer advocates called this cycle a “debt trap” and argued that payday lenders, much like credit-card companies, disguised the true costs of their products. Store clerks emphasized the small-seeming fees and pushed customers to roll their old loans into new ones, so that the fees snowballed, eventually exceeding the cost of the original loan. While most banks made money by finding customers who could repay their debts on time, payday lenders made money by finding customers who couldn’t. “If borrowers repaid loans in just two weeks and walked away as advertised, lenders would go out of business,” Bourke says.\n","\n","What really distinguishes the short-term loan industry from regular banks is precisely the focus on finding customers who will default. They’ve also historically been unregulated by the federal government and free to charge grossly usurious rates. Several states decided to regulate the industry at the end of the last decade, and some like North Carolina banned payday loans outright.\n","\n","Naturally, there are some consumers who have good experiences taking out emergency loans, and it can work for someone with poor credit who genuinely needs to borrow money for a very short period of time. These feel-good stories are what the industry relies on to rationalize their predatory business model. The overall effect of the industry is ruinous, however, as it sucks up billions of dollars from the people least able to part with their money.\n","\n","The CFPB didn’t initially think that the payday loan industry would be a high priority for them. But that quickly changed once they opened their doors under their first director, Richard Cordray:\n","\n","As the human and financial costs of the subprime-mortgage crash mounted, the new bureau was inundated with whistle-blower tips and consumer complaints. Cordray and his leadership team initially planned to focus on the biggest consumer-finance players, like mortgage lenders and credit-card companies; payday lenders were a relatively small industry compared with Wall Street. But it was growing quickly: The crisis had been good for business, pulling more middle-class families into the payday-loan market. And unlike banks, payday lenders were unregulated by the federal government. “It was affecting a lot of people at the margins who could least afford to run into trouble,” Cordray told me recently. In 2012, the C.F.P.B. began conducting supervisory exams of payday lenders, a process that required them to open up their offices and books, and sometimes yielded evidence of predatory lending for the bureau’s enforcement team to take up. A company called Ace Cash Express, investigators found, harassed overdue borrowers by using phony legal threats. The investigation yielded a potent illustration of the debt trap: Ace Cash’s training manual, which instructed employees to pressure borrowers into paying off overdue loans by taking out new ones, illustrated its customer-service doctrine with a graphic resembling a recycling symbol, with one “short-term” loan fueling the next in an endless loop of debt.\n","\n","At first, the CFPB went after the most egregious examples of exploitative behavior they could find, and they also put an emphasis on online lenders. In 2015, they began developing a new rule to apply to the industry that they hoped would end the practice of making deliberately bad loans. Lenders would be scrutinized, and they would be expected to examine a borrower’s ability to repay a loan before granting them one. Systemic abuse of the system could lead to hefty fine and even criminal charges. Before the new rule could be implemented, however, Donald Trump surprisingly won the 2016 election.\n","\n","He then jammed Mick Mulvaney in as the interim replacement for Richard Cordray, and Mulvaney set about not only saving the payday lenders from oversight and regulation but cutting the teeth out of the entire bureau. He was so effective at this job that Trump was convinced to make him the White House chief of staff.\n","\n","All is not lost, and if a Democrat wins the presidency in 2020 the bureau may be salvageable as an advocate for working people. I imagine a President Elizabeth Warren would be especially invested in that outcome. It seems to me that if people grasped that the Republican Party is on the side of predatory lenders and against protecting people from fine-print scams and debt traps, that a lot of them would be less inclined to take their side because of cultural issues.\n","\n","The problem is getting them to understand this when there is not much effort going on to keep them focused on NFL players and scary immigrants and the War on Christmas.\n","['More Nancy Letourneau'] 2020-08-06 00:00:00 One of the staples of presidential elections has become the so-called “October surprise.” Often occurring in the final days before an election, the targets of such a surprise are constrained from defending themselves because of the lack of time to do so. As Max Boot suggests, the Trump administration could be in the process of planning several October surprises, which would mean even more chaos in the run-up to the November election.\n","\n","In addition to what the president and his campaign have planned, Attorney General William Barr is all but promising to launch his own October surprise. As Ken Dilanian reports, the federal prosecutor Barr tasked with investigating the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, John Durham, is nearing completion of his work. As a final step, Durham is in the process of arranging an interview with the man Barr has been targeting all along—former CIA Director John Brennan.\n","\n","It is important to keep in mind that the attorney general came to a conclusion about this investigation before he was even nominated for his current position. For example, back in 2017, Barr told Peter Baker that he saw “more basis for investigating the uranium deal [ie, Hillary Clinton] than any supposed collusion between Mr. Trump and Russia.” And nearly a year before he determined that Trump had not obstructed justice during the Trump-Russia probe, Barr sent a letter to Rod Rosenstein criticizing the Mueller investigation and suggesting that it wasn’t possible for Trump to have obstructed justice.\n","\n","As attorney general, Barr has repeatedly said that the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign and publicly stated his disagreement with Inspector General Horowitz’s findings that the FBI had evidence to support the launch of the Trump-Russia probe. Here are a few other public statements the attorney general has made.\n","\n","He called the Justice Department’s investigation into Russian interference “one of the greatest travesties in American history,” claiming that it had been undertaken “without any basis” and that the investigators were “trying to sabotage the presidency.”\n","\n","Referring to the Durham investigation he said, “My own view is that the evidence shows that we’re not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness, there was something far more troubling here; and we’re going to get to the bottom of it.”\n","\n","In Congressional testimony last month, he vowed to do everything he could “to get to the bottom of the grave abuses involved in the bogus ‘Russiagate’ scandal…”\n","\n","In other words, Durham’s investigation is simply cover for conclusions the attorney general reached long ago. That is precisely why Benjamin Wittes warned that the least tyrant-proof part of the government is the Justice Department. Quoting Justice Robert Jackson, he went on to describe exactly what Barr assigned Durham to do.\n","\n","With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in this realm—in which the prosecutor picks some person whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the greatest danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.\n","\n","No matter how inconsequential, Durham will find something. Then Barr will get to work. Tossing aside Justice Department guidelines on restrictions against interference in elections, he told Congress last month that he would not wait until after the election to release Durham’s findings once they are finalized.\n","\n","Barr has left no doubt that he is in the midst of planning his own October surprise in a blatant attempt to benefit the incumbent president. That would be a stunning development, even for an attorney general who has already completely destroyed the independence of the Justice Department.\n","['More Nancy Letourneau'] 2020-08-06 00:00:00 It’s never a good idea to put too much stock in issue polls. As we’ve seen time and time again, the wording of the question often determines the outcome. But when it comes to health care—and especially Medicaid expansion—we don’t need polls, because even voters in red states are making it clear that they are not aligned with Republicans.\n","\n","On Tuesday, Missouri became the seventh state to expand Medicaid since Donald Trump was inaugurated. All but one of those states (Virginia) did so by referendum at the ballot box. You can now add Missouri to the group of orange states on this map.\n","\n","The 53 percent of Missourians who voted to expand Medicaid probably did so for a variety of reasons, like the fact that an additional 230,000 people will gain insurance coverage, or the fact that a refusal to expand the program has contributed to the closing of 10 rural hospitals in that state since 2014. There’s also this concern:\n","\n","“Quite frankly, Missourians are sick and tired of not getting their fair share. They pay their taxes, they’ve seen now 37 other states use that money to expand access to health care. Meanwhile, our economy’s clearly ailing here,” Jack Cardetti, the campaign’s spokesperson, said last week.\n","\n","As Sarah Kliff explains, the group that is behind the strategy of putting Medicaid expansion on the ballot is the Fairness Project. So far, they’ve had a massive impact, expanding the program to cover an additional one million low-income Americans. Their next target is Florida, which, if passed, would add coverage for an additional 800,000. Republican governors and legislators have fought these gains every step of the way. But Medicaid expansion has passed whenever it has been put on the ballot.\n","\n","The lesson here is that, even as Trump and Republicans ask the Supreme Court to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, their own constituents in red states are telling them that they support a critical element of what that legislation accomplished. A party that actually cared about what American voters want would be paying attention.\n","['More Robert J. Shapiro'] 2020-08-05 00:00:00 The headline from last Thursday’s report by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on second quarter GDP was horrific: The economy contracted 9.5 percent from April through June. On an annual basis, GDP fell at an astounding rate of nearly 33 percent. Still, there’s another ominous aspect to the agency’s findings that has gone largely unnoted: The pandemic-driven collapse in GDP occurred even with trillions of dollars of government aid dispensed through emergency checks to households, expanded jobless benefits, and payroll grants.\n","\n","Now, as the pandemic worsens again—infections are surging across much of the South, Southwest and Midwest—we may well need to face another period of largescale shutdowns, like those that stalled out the economy in April and May. But the White House and congressional Republicans are balking at a second, comparable round of emergency assistance. The data suggest that their quibbling and stalling risks a national depression.\n","\n","The BEA’s latest report on personal incomes, released the day after its latest GDP report, can give us a rough measure of what might happen if President Trump and GOP leaders block another round of federal supports at least as large as the first one.\n","\n","Over the second quarter of 2020, personal income from salaries and wages fell 7.1 percent even as total personal income grew 7.3 percent. That gaping difference was bridged mainly by the emergency checks and expanded jobless benefits from the federal government.\n","\n","The report also shows that personal consumption fell 10.5 percent even as the emergency checks and extended jobless benefits provided $1,420 billion in income support. That’s because people spend a lot less when unemployment sets new records. Instead, they cut out most non-essential spending and save a lot more to tide themselves for even worse times: The personal saving rate, which averaged 7.5 percent in 2019, soared to 25.7 percent in the second quarter.\n","\n","Worse times may be right on the horizon if Trump and his allies continue to delay and diminish a second round of emergency assistance. We can estimate what would happen to personal incomes, consumption spending, and GDP if this second spike of infections produces shutdowns and unemployment in August and September akin to the first spike in April and May, although without the emergency aid from the government. Personal income would fall 7.0 percent below the depressed levels in the second quarter, or more than $1,424 billion. Personal consumption, which declined at an annual rate of $1,528 billion from March through May, would be further depressed by the absence of another $1,055 billion (the $1,420 billion in emergency aid minus the 25.7 percent saved). From July through September—the months leading up to the election—Americans would spend nearly 18 percent less than they did from January through March.\n","\n","That means the GDP would not begin to recover at all. The overall economy would be nearly as depressed in the third quarter as it was in the disastrous second quarter, and possibly worse. This is the fire that the Trump administration and Congress are playing with, and it could burn down a good part of the U.S. economy.\n","\n","In a week or two, the White House and congressional Republicans will likely try to avoid this dire scenario—or at least the responsibility for it—by pushing a sharply pared down version of the emergency package passed more than two months ago by House Democrats. .\n","\n","The version offered by GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell would provide $1 trillion in assistance, i.e. one-third the support in the Democratic package. The GOP plan would cut the $600 expanded jobless benefit to $200, eliminate pay supplements for essential workers in hazardous jobs, and provide little aid to state and local governments. The plan does include another round of $1,200 checks for most people, with the funds paid over several months and without the additional support for children in the Democrats’ bill.\n","\n","There is no economic justification for a half loaf here and the GOP’s cuts in emergency funding will exact appalling costs on millions of households. Based on all of our economic and epidemiological information, the right course for anyone not seized by love or fear of Donald Trump is to press for a new round of assistance as least as large as the measures enacted last time.\n","\n","Major aid disbursements to America’s families is also the only equitable course. The crisis has already ended, kaput, for large investors—the top 10 percent of Americans who own 91 percent of all financial assets—because the Federal Reserve’s aggressive operations have virtually restored the stock and bond markets.\n","\n","From February 20 to March 23, the S&P 500 tumbled almost 34 percent from its historic high of 3,372 to 2,237. Yet, as the economy has continued to tank from March 23 onward, $2.8 trillion in new Fed purchases pushed the S&P 500 back to 3,296 on August 3, just two percent from its historic high. The Fed’s operations have had the same impact on corporate bond markets, with both investment grade paper and junk bonds reversing virtually all of their recent losses even as GDP cratered.\n","\n","Nevertheless, President Trump and GOP leaders have dismissed their obligation to provide large-scale support for everyone else and take the steps needed to break the pandemic.In a plummeting economy, they apparently have chosen Hebert Hoover as their role model, another Republican president with a GOP-controlled Congress who rejected calls for wide-ranging government assistance for an economic crisis. The result, of course, was the Great Depression.\n","['More Daniel Epps', 'Maria Glover'] 2020-08-06 00:00:00 Last week, Senate Republicans unveiled the HEALS Act, their proposal to address the continued devastation that COVID-19 is wreaking on the country. The Act, a collection of discrete bills authored by various Senators, would have far-reaching consequences. One of the bills, Texas Senator John Cornyn’s SAFE TO WORK Act, would restrict lawsuits based on coronavirus exposure against employers, businesses, and many other potential defendants. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that the liability restrictions are a critical Republican requirement for further COVID-19 relief measures.\n","\n","Senator Cornyn claims that his bill “would protect those acting in good faith from being sued into oblivion while ensuring bad actors who willingly put their patients, employees, or customers in danger will still be held accountable.” Employers and businesses no doubt are dealing with great challenges given these extraordinary circumstances. And it is sensible for legislators to seek a balance between accountability for bad actors who fail to take reasonable precautions and the threat of ruinous liability for employers and businesses doing their best. Yet the bill’s complex procedural requirements make any hope of accountability impossible. In fact, the bill actually encourages harmful behavior.\n","\n","The legislation’s provisions are complex, but here’s a brief overview of how it works. It creates a new federal cause of action that preempts other federal, state, or tribal causes of action “related to recovery for personal injuries caused by actual, alleged, feared, or potential for exposure to coronavirus.” The federal cause of action requires plaintiffs to prove that the defendant’s “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” caused injury. That means that even if, say, Missouri law permitted a line cook harmed by a restaurant’s ordinary negligence that caused them to contract COVID-19 to sue for damages, federal law would forbid the suit. The only exception is for laws that are more restrictive, meaning the goal isn’t uniformity, just limits on liability.\n","\n","This alone is quite significant. The bill is purportedly justified under Congress’s constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce. Senator Cornyn himself has previously stressed that “the states retain the general lawmaking power” and rejected the notion that “the power to regulate interstate commerce essentially makes the federal government a government of unlimited power.” Yet he and his fellow Republicans, who extol the virtues of federalism, seem happy enough to make an unprecedented federal power grab here by federalizing tort law—which is normally within states’ control. That’s especially unjustified given that many states have already begun crafting liability-limitation legislation.\n","\n","But the bill goes much further. It contains numerous interlocking procedural restrictions that make it essentially impossible for a plaintiff to prevail. For one, the bill requires proof by “clear and convincing” evidence—an unusually high burden for most civil cases. It requires plaintiffs to detail their factual allegations with a much higher degree of specificity than is usually required.\n","\n","The bill also creates a “safe harbor” for defendants, which says that whenever a defendant can point to any “written or published policy” in line with applicable government regulations, the defendant will be presumed to have acted reasonably, even if the “policy” is just boilerplate language they did not actually follow. If a defendant’s motion to dismiss the suit is unsuccessful, it can take an immediate appeal—potentially delaying litigation for years. Plaintiffs’ ability to obtain relevant evidence through discovery is sharply limited. Damages for any plaintiff lucky enough to achieve a victory are restricted.\n","\n","Each one of these requirements individually puts a big thumb on the scale in favor of defendants. Collectively, they pose nearly insuperable obstacles to recovery for plaintiffs—even when they seek recovery from actors who engaged in egregious misconduct that caused death or serious injury. The effect will be to discourage entities, such as warehouse operators or meat-packing plants, to take even reasonable precautions to prevent harm.\n","\n","But few plaintiffs would really ever risk getting this far. That’s because of the worst provisions in what is already a bad bill. The Act doesn’t just make it hard for plaintiffs to win; it makes it potentially devastating for them to even consider suit. If a victim requests compensation “in exchange for settling . . . or otherwise not pursuing a claim that is, or could be, brought as part of a coronavirus-related action,” the recipient of the request can seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees if the claim is “meritless.”\n","\n","Given how hard the Act makes it to win such claims, and how easy it makes it for defendants to demonstrate that they took “reasonable precautions,” the Act has all but pre-ordained all COVID-19 claims as “meritless.” In practice, an employee who merely emails her employer requesting compensation for COVID-19-related harm caused by the employer’s negligence exposes herself to thousands of dollars in damages. This provision would discourage reasonable requests for compensation by employees. And it may well violate the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech, given that it effectively punishes employees for simply communicating with their employers.\n","\n","Nor will victims easily find legal representation. Lawyers, too, can be sued for “meritless” compensation requests. The Act also permits the U.S. Attorney General to sue anyone who he “has reasonable cause to believe . . . is engaged in a pattern or practice of transmitting demands for remuneration” that are meritless. Each compensation demand exposes the sender to a civil fine of up to $50,000.\n","\n","Lawyers representing COVID-19 plaintiffs would quickly be put out of business. At the same time, the bill would create a cottage industry for suits against injured plaintiffs and their attorneys. These lucrative countersuits are subject to none of the stringent requirements the bill places on injured parties seeking compensation.\n","\n","In total, the bill represents an assault on the American civil justice system that is without precedent in federal law. In the few instances where Congress has broadly preempted state lawsuits, it has done so alongside federal regulatory schemes designed to promote the public good or alternative systems for compensating injured parties. Congress preempted lawsuits against the airline industry arising out of the September 11 attacks, but it quickly created a Victims’ Compensation Fund to compensate 9/11 victims and their families. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act bars tort claims against vaccine manufacturers, but it also created a compensation program to provide recovery to those injured by vaccines without the need to establish fault by the manufacturer. Here, by contrast, Senate Republicans want to prevent states from using tort liability, but they are leaving health regulation to the states and aren’t creating any federal mechanisms for compensating victims.\n","\n","There are steps Congress might take that would strike an appropriate balance between victim’s interests, the need to protect essential services acting reasonably, and federalism values. Instead, this bill gives businesses a free pass at the expense of COVID-19’s victims. If passed into law, the bill would make it anything but safe for the country to go back to work.\n","['More Martin Longman'] 2020-08-06 00:00:00 I wrote a piece on June 24, 2020, called “Trump Has Destroyed the GOP’s Vote-by-Mail Advantage in Florida.” On Wednesday, August 5, 2020, you got the opportunity to read the same thing in the Washington Post. At some point between these two articles, someone finally got through to Trump and made him understand his error:\n","\n","https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1290967953542909952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1290967953542909952%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fopinions%2F2020%2F08%2F05%2Ftrump-his-spinners-are-suddenly-freaking-out-about-florida-heres-why%2F\n","\n","As Greg Sargent notes, the campaign’s goal here is “to delegitimize vote-by-mail in states where they think it will hurt Trump, while legitimizing it in places where they think it will help him.” This is a fallback position — an effort at mitigation. As I predicted, Republican voters were not able to make fine distinctions about where mail voting is good and desirable and where it is bad and corrupt. When Trump attacked expanded mail voting in states like Michigan, it made his base reluctant to trust mail voting in states like Florida where the practice has been long established.\n","\n","Rather than admit a strategic blunder or completely change course, the attempt at a solution involves promoting mail voting where there is a “great infrastructure” and “great Republican Governors” and dissuading it where it is being newly introduced by Democratic governors.\n","\n","To be clear, this really was a blunder:\n","\n","As of Wednesday, more than 600,000 more Democrats had requested mail ballots than Republicans, according to the University of Florida’s Michael McDonald. For comparison: in the 2018 governor’s race, Republican Ron DeSantis beat Democrat Andrew Gillum by fewer than 50,000 votes. Similarly, a recent CNN/SSRS poll found that 59% of voters who “lean Democratic” said they would prefer to vote via mail ballot compared to just 21% of Republican-leaning voters.\n","\n","When I wrote my piece in June, the Democrats’ advantage was only 302,000 voters, and I already considered that catastrophic for the president. Fortunately, he doesn’t listen to me, but he did eventually get the message after losing in every survey of Florida taken in July.\n","\n","There’s a secondary play here, too, that we must consider. A lot of votes will be uncounted on election night, and as a result some states may not be called for either candidate. Trump may want to argue that the counting should stop, especially if he has a narrow lead that is likely to evaporate once all the mail votes are included. He’s preparing the ground for that argument, so this is more serious than just a laughable effort at mitigation. Biden needs to prep the battlefield in response.\n","['More Jodi Enda'] 2020-11-04 00:00:00 The news is this: Everything has changed and nothing has changed.\n","\n","In his upset victory four years ago, Donald Trump plowed through the nation’s political terrain. He tapped into deep-seated rage and anguish among a large swath of Americans that the establishment of both parties had failed to recognize, let alone address.\n","\n","Since then, Trump has changed Washington, not by “draining the swamp” as he promised, but by taking over the Republican Party, by turning GOP lawmakers into rubber stamps and squelching or crushing them if they didn’t comply.\n","\n","Few put up a fight, and the reason became clear this week: Trump is good for them. Not just for their policy goals, such as cutting taxes and packing federal courts with conservatives, though that is undeniable. But for the lawmakers themselves.\n","\n","He is particularly good for those who cling to him. Take Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Graham harshly criticized Trump – and briefly ran against him — in 2016. But the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee now embraces Trump, and Tuesday, he trounced a Democrat who had polled strongly in recent weeks. Likewise, Sen. Thom Tillis once earned Trump’s wrath by offering a bill to prevent the administration from firing the special counsel in the Russia investigation. After that, he cleaved to the president and appears to have survived a close reelection contest in North Carolina. Republican senators who chided the president, including Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee, found it easier to leave the chamber than face brutal MAGA-fueled primaries. Members of Congress who took shots at Trump, such as Barbara Comstock of Virginia or Carlos Curbelo of Florida, lost their seats in 2018.\n","\n","When Trump’s name is on the top of the ballot, Republicans down the line do better.\n","\n","It feels strange to write that sentence since Trump himself might lose the presidency in this nail-biter of an election.\n","\n","But it remains true that both times he topped the ticket, Republicans down the ballot out-performed expectations. This year, they appear poised to gain seats in the House – an unwelcome surprise to the reigning Democrats – and to retain control of the Senate, which few expected. Compare that to 2018, when Trump was not running for office and Democrats gained an astounding 40 seats to take control of the House. And while the party of the incumbent president often sheds congressional seats in midterm elections, the numbers generally are less mind-boggling than they were two years ago.\n","\n","Throughout 2020, Democrats had hoped for a “blue wave” reminiscent of 2018, but this time with an even loftier goal: control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. They adhered to the belief that a big turnout, in and of itself, would be good for the people’s party.\n","\n","They also longed to flip some statehouses in time for this decade’s redistricting. That didn’t happen. Currently, Republicans control both chambers in 29 state legislatures, and Democrats control both chambers in 19. Minnesota is the only statehouse in which each party controls one chamber, and Nebraska’s legislature is nonpartisan. As of Wednesday afternoon, the National Conference of State Legislatures said few changes were in the offing, and none had been called. In fact, the conference reported, this year could see the smallest number of changes in legislative control since 1944, when four chambers switched hands.\n","\n","Further, partisan control will shift in only one governor’s mansion; Montana elected Republican Greg Gianforte to fill the position vacated by Democrat Steve Bullock, who lost his bid for the Senate. Gianforte may best be known nationally for slugging a reporter.\n","\n","So it remains conceivable that Trump will have led just about everyone in his party to win – except perhaps himself.\n","\n","But Trump did something else, too.\n","\n","He has kept the rage alive. His cult of personality has generated countless diehards who question nothing their leader says, no matter how divorced from reality. Conversely, Trump’s affronts to tradition, decorum, and, often, civility have enraged others who not only don’t understand his appeal but are revolted by it.\n","\n","The result is that the nation remains at least as divided in 2020 as it was in 2016. The too-close-to-call election has assured that win or lose, Trump will continue to stoke that division, to demand the spotlight, to foment and employ that rage. A few weeks ago, many political observers were asking if Trumpism would outlast Trump. That’s not the question anymore. Trump is going to be a behemoth on the national landscape, inside the White House or out.\n","\n","The ranks of his supporters, in this year of high turnout, have grown since 2016. They stuck with him through impeachment, the pandemic, the turned-down economy. They are the foot soldiers of Trumpism and are likely to remain so. Their MAGA hats will not suddenly vanish.\n","\n","As the ballot counters forged ahead Wednesday afternoon, former Vice President Joe Biden took to the microphones in Delaware and attempted to set a more calibrated tone for the nation he still expected to lead.\n","\n","“It’s time for us to do what we have always done as Americans – to put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us…To unite, to heal, to come together as a nation,” Biden said.\n","\n","Earlier Wednesday morning, Trump audaciously tried to declare victory, threatening to ask the Supreme Court to put a stop to vote counting. His false proclamation – “Frankly, we did win this election” – served only to further divide the nation. The rage had not subsided.\n","\n","Everything might change. And nothing.\n","['More Nancy Letourneau'] 2019-03-19 00:00:00 Given what we know about Donald Trump and the presidency, I have been suggesting for a long time that his mental status will not get any better and can only get worse. As that prediction materializes, the president’s behavior has triggered several conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health.\n","\n","The most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, who served under three Republican presidents and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting to some of Trump’s more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehner refers to the president as “a damaged soul with a disordered personality.”\n","\n","It doesn’t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology to see Trump’s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or his shamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better—and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses… Whether the worst scenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what we do know is that the president is a person who seems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead. Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is not safe.\n","\n","Leading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president’s mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of a stream where he reacted to some of Trump’s lies.\n","\n","Conway tweeted the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, “Tell us, @realDonaldTrump—which of these diagnostic criteria do you not satisfy?” To explain, he tweeted a link to an article in Rolling Stone titled, “Trump’s Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump’s Behavior?”\n","\n","At one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern.\n","\n","Jennifer Rubin joined the bandwagon.\n","\n","Whether meant seriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein’s alleged consideration of the 25th Amendment seems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as FBI director and the appointment of a special counsel, Trump’s mental and emotional health has seemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy theories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from the special counsel and widespread criticism of the president’s unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration.\n","\n","These are not warnings coming from partisans seeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and those serving in Trump’s cabinet to take the situation seriously, before it’s too late.\n","[] 2021-06-17 00:00:00 Placeholder while article actions load\n","\n","Barely a week into office, President Biden made a promise that signaled a sharp break from his predecessor: No member of his family would be involved in government.

In the first few months of Biden’s presidency, at least five children of his top aides have secured coveted jobs in the new administration. They include two sons and a daughter of the White House counselor, the daughter of a deputy White House chief of staff and the daughter of the director of presidential personnel.\n","\n","The pattern — which continued this week with the Treasury Department’s announcement that it was hiring J.J.

They include the wife of White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain and the sister of White House press secretary Jen Psaki.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Federal law generally prohibits government officials from hiring close relatives or encouraging their hiring, and there is no evidence that any of Biden’s aides have played a role in securing the jobs for their children or other relatives.\n","\n","The White House has maintained that everyone hired is well qualified for their positions.\n","\n","“The president has instituted the highest ethical standards of anyone to ever hold this office,” deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates said. “And he’s proud to have staffed the most diverse administration in American history with well-qualified public servants who reflect his values.”\n","\n","But the hiring of senior aides’ children remains alarming to ethics experts, because it suggests that people with ties to high-ranking public servants might be getting an advantage over similarly qualified people for low-ranking positions, which often serve as a foot in the door to a career in government and politics.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Many Biden supporters hoped the new administration, which has stressed its commitment to inclusivity and diversity, would fill those positions with qualified applicants who lack powerful connections. Some argue that goal is hindered by hiring the children of Biden’s closest aides, who are mostly White and some of whom are wealthy.\n","\n","On Monday, the Treasury Department announced the hiring of J.J. Ricchetti, a 2020 college graduate whose father is one of Biden’s most trusted West Wing aides. Ricchetti is assuming a junior-level position as special assistant in the Office of Legislative Affairs.\n","\n","Steve Ricchetti’s daughter, Shannon Ricchetti, who graduated from college in 2016, is deputy associate director of the office of the White House social secretary, a job she secured after working at the Aspen Institute and on the Biden transition team.

Julia Reed earned praise from Biden aides for her work on the advance staff of his presidential campaign.\n","\n","“In a country that had just come through a pandemic, how can these children of political appointees be the only people who are qualified for employment?” Shaub said.\n","\n","The familial web in the Biden administration extends beyond children of White House officials. The White House press secretary’s sister, Stephanie Psaki, was appointed a senior adviser at the Health and Human Services Department in March.

This article has been corrected.\n","\n","FORT BRAGG, Calif. — This town took a big step toward making fresh water along the rocky, wild North Coast of California. As its wells ran dry this month, town officials looked to technology as an emergency measure, hoping to keep both residents and a lifeblood tourism industry with running faucets. The town spent $335,000 on a desalination plant, a small machine of tubes and pumps that officials christened earlier this month. Turning brackish water into useful water, the plant now provides a quarter of the local supply.\n","\n","Just a few miles down Highway 1, desperate residents of another town have been urged to buy thousand-gallon storage tanks to catch any water that may fall from the sky. And over the coastal range to the east, Ukiah is awash in water and has begun sending tankers full to its dry neighbors near the sea.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","The vastly different ways these small towns between San Francisco and the Oregon border are managing their water supplies highlight how uneven California’s brutal drought has been across the state — and even within a single county. Traditionally one of California’s wettest, Mendocino County is now a confused mountain-and-valley geography of damp and dry as the climate changes.\n","\n","This was the first year in memory that Fort Bragg could not sell its surplus water to Mendocino Village, an old lumber town of historic Victorians and homegrown boutiques. That town has run completely dry, and the only water it receives is trucked in from Ukiah, the Mendocino County seat. Tracing the water shipments nearly 70 miles from Ukiah through Fort Bragg and into Mendocino Village shows the unprecedented steps the haves and have-nots are taking to keep water flowing.\n","\n","“We don’t know how long this is going to last, and we expect the consequences of drought to grow worse with duration,” said Jeanine Jones, the drought manager for the state Department of Water Resources. “That’s what makes this so different.”\n","\n","The drying of the American West, as well as the inconsistencies of the winners and losers when it comes to its most precious natural resource, is evident from the rapidly retreating Great Salt Lake to shrinking Lake Tahoe, to the rain shadows cast by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains to the historic lows of Lake Mead, highlighted earlier this week when Vice President Harris visited.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","The geology-caused inconsistencies are apparent in the vast Central Valley, where sandy, silty underground natural reservoirs keep well water available, even if wealthy farmers are the only ones who can afford to drill deeper and deeper to get it. San Diego County has plenty of water even though it is a near-desert, importing almost all of its supply from the shrinking Colorado River and historically wet Northern California.\n","\n","Then there is the climate, shifting so quickly in recent years from wet to dry, cold to hot, that water officials at all levels of government have no way of predicting rainfall or the extent of future Sierra Nevada snow caps.\n","\n","Earlier this month, the Sierra got its first snow dusting of the year while simultaneously, here and across much of Northern California, high heat and gusting wind prompted fire officials to issue a “red flag” warning of elevated fire risk. Storms are forecast for this weekend and into next week. While bringing much-needed rain and the possibility of raising reservoir levels, the storms overall are not expected to dent the drought.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","California’s summer, from July through September, was the driest since 1895, when the government began keeping drought records. The state government’s calls for conservation, meanwhile, have resulted in well-below necessary savings.\n","\n","“At this point we’re just trying to figure out what is going to happen next year,” said Tabatha Miller, the city manager of Fort Bragg, built largely on fractured rock that cannot hold water underground, a problem shared by many of California’s coastal towns. “Where do we get more supply? How do we store what we have? No one knows when this is going to end.”\n","\n","The challenges within one county\n","\n","This tale of three towns, all within the wine-and-weed country of Mendocino County, highlights how near-neighbors are confronting Year Two of a drought that came on faster and has the potential to last longer than others in the state’s recent history.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Many here settled in the county’s small, scattered towns decades ago as part of the post-Summer of Love, back-to-the land movement. And now everyone is trying to pitch in.\n","\n","But Mendocino, which relies mostly on ground water, has a set of unique challenges that complicate efforts at conservation.\n","\n","The county has not had a summer tourist season as big as this one for years, as people with pent-up wanderlust flow into the bed-and-breakfasts along this lovely coast. Tourists, though, bring more than just revenue to the town. They also drive up water use, complicating conservation efforts. Signs plastered across Mendocino Village, for example, warn visitors of “Severe Drought, Please Conserve Water, Our Wells Run Dry.”\n","\n","The other issue undermining conservation efforts is the marijuana industry, made legal by state voters in 2016 but struggling to shed a half-century of outlaw culture, regulatory costs and closed-book accounting to meet state licensing requirements.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Today there are 1,100 cannabis farmers working their way through the county regulatory system. County officials estimate that there are more than 6,000 — and perhaps as many as 9,000 — illegal growers still operating large farms of the water-intensive crop.\n","\n","“With the drought on top of this, people freaked out,” said John Haschak, a Mendocino County supervisor who sits on a local drought task force. “There isn’t enough water as it is in much of the county, and this crop is a big draw down.”\n","\n","Along with its marijuana, Mendocino’s wine and pear crops are renowned. All have taken a hit, whether through the intentional fallowing of crops that farmers cannot water or fruit simply withering on the vine, depending on where the crops sit.\n","\n","Glenn McGourty, a Mendocino County supervisor who also sits on the local drought task force, grows a variety of white-wine grapes on more than seven acres along the Russian River.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","His allotment of river water was cut a few months ago, and he has no ground water to rely on.

But the climate here is changing rapidly, making some of the agreements it has reached to sell its water outside the county when it was one of the state’s wettest places appear shortsighted.\n","\n","The drought, California’s worst in a century, came on so fast and deepened so quickly with hot, dry weather that it blindsided many county officials.\n","\n","Lake Mendocino, a few miles outside Ukiah, is at one of its lowest levels in memory — the telltale “bathtub” rings show a series of high-water marks far above the current water line. In April, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) used the lake as a backdrop for his announcement of an emergency drought declaration for parts of the North Coast, an order he extended this week to cover the entire state. His calls for a 15 percent reduction in water use statewide have not been met.\n","\n","Even when full, Lake Mendocino does little for local farmers and businesses. An agreement reached in the 1950s, long before years-long droughts were imagined as regular occurrences in wet Northern California, requires Mendocino to send most of the Lake Mendocino supply south to Marin and Sonoma counties.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Ukiah itself sits on an alluvial aquifer, as does much of the Central Valley. It is silty and soft, absorbing water as it trickles down to the water table. This is ideal underground storage in contrast to the rocky hydrology of the rough North Coast. Even when the lake gets low, Ukiah has enough underground water to share with its more geologically challenged neighbors.\n","\n","As the only Mendocino city with water, Ukiah is trucking it west over the steep Mendocino Range, carpeted with giant redwoods and fir, to Fort Bragg, now serving as a water way station rather than a source. The shipment amounts to 50,000 gallons a day at a cost of $16,000 per shipment. A person uses an estimated 55 gallons a day, Fort Bragg officials said.\n","\n","Ukiah received $2 million from the state to help defray the costs, and the county itself subsidizes about $800 of each shipment. Once it reaches Fort Bragg, the water is transferred into smaller tankers for home deliveries in Mendocino Village.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","“The state wants this to be a one-time deal, and we want it to be a one-time deal,” said Haschak, a former public-school teacher who has lived in Mendocino since 1969. “It’s just not a sustainable model.”\n","\n","None of the signs warning of drought and urging conservation are apparent along Ukiah’s roads, although county officials have set up an emergency drought committee and urge residents to save.\n","\n","The town in the middle\n","\n","Fort Bragg was named for Braxton Bragg, a U.S. Army officer in the Mexican-American War who was then commissioned a general in the Confederate army. One of the general’s underlings gave the city its name, which has been a source of controversy for decades.\n","\n","Cresting the curvy Highway 20 as it rises over the Mendocino Range, travelers slope down to the sea, skirt the coast for a few miles near the Noyo River, which empties at Fort Bragg into a windblown Pacific dabbed by white caps.\n","\n","“Welcome to Fort Bragg,” the jolly greeting reads. “Save our Water.”\n","\n","The town of about 6,000, not including the seasonal inundation of tourists, evokes the frontier and still emphasizes independence. The Heavenly Soles shoe shop and the Spunky Skunk toy store capture the small-business spirit of the place.\n","\n","Earlier this month, a few days of rain helped fill the small reservoirs Fort Bragg has built in the past five years, offering a respite from imminent empty faucets across the town. Fort Bragg residents rely on private wells and the city’s water system that draws from a small reservoir and the Noyo River, which splits the town as it flows into the Pacific.\n","\n","Fort Bragg officials had already informed Mendocino Village that it would not be able to sell the town, perched on a rocky promontory 10 miles to the south, water this year as it has done in the past.\n","\n","They had their own shortages to worry about.\n","\n","Over the first year of the drought, which coincided largely with the pandemic stay-at-home orders, town residents here cut their water use by 30 percent. But the lifting of the pandemic rules brought people here in huge numbers — “Our best year ever,” in Miller’s words — which helped wipe out those water savings.\n","\n","“A lot of what’s happening in terms of water use now is simply the result of the state coming out of covid,” Miller said.\n","\n","The desalination plant is unlikely to alter that fundamentally anytime soon, as town officials try to assess what the winter will bring and what will be needed next year.\n","\n","Already, though, they are more optimistic about the plant than the steps they took during the last drought, including a townwide advisory to use disposable plates instead of those that needed washing, which led to clogged landfills and a lot of plastic waste.\n","\n","The plant could produce 144,000 gallons of fresh water a day, a quarter of the town’s needs. Because the water flowing through it is brackish and not pure, salt-rich ocean water, the plant does not have to work as hard or draw as much electricity to purify it. Town officials do not expect water prices to rise as a result.\n","\n","“We’re certainly looking at having to rely on it even more next year,” Miller said. “But this is definitely a temporary measure for us and for the region.”\n","\n","Plastic tanks and bathtubs\n","\n","There is no water in Mendocino Village, another big tourist draw along the well-traveled Highway 1. Not in the wells, not in underground reservoirs. Nowhere.\n","\n","It is a town that logging made rich in the past century and a half — the large, graceful Victorians lining narrow streets that run toward the ocean a testament to that wealth.\n","\n","One is the Joshua Grindle House, graced by a carved, lacy Victorian overhang above its wraparound veranda. Grindle was a lumber magnate. A sign announcing that it was built in 1879 hangs at the driveway entrance, along with another pleading for guests to save water during their stay.\n","\n","In the apple tree-lined backyard, once a large vegetable garden that has been cleared for conservation reasons, Kate Taylor recently hosted a “water workshop” attended by many business owners in town. She also joins conference calls each Monday morning with others in town to assess water conditions and share thoughts on conservation.\n","\n","Taylor and her husband, Ken, bought the 10-room house nearly three years ago and turned it into an inn. “There are way more people in town right now with the end of covid,” Taylor said. “And, frankly, that is taking a real toll on the town.”\n","\n","That is the “losing when winning” dilemma of being a tourist town, post-pandemic, in a place without water. Taylor did not take any water deliveries this year, mainly because Fort Bragg has ceased doing them directly. She did the previous year.\n","\n","Mendocino Village residents are entirely dependent on water drawn from their private wells and what they can store in multiplying backyard tanks. There is no reservoir, no water system here on the stone shores of the Pacific.\n","\n","Taylor has installed a 4,999-gallon plastic water tank, a new Mendocino architectural aesthetic that town leaders have urged owners to partially hide from view. “And, of course, it rained the day we put it up, so we missed all of it,” Taylor said. “It hasn’t rained since.”\n","\n","She plans to buy a few more, and, meanwhile, has developed a way to use the unpotable water from the tanks and other “gray water” to irrigate a fallow garden that she hopes will soon be a draw for her guests. She has not had second thoughts about her move.\n","\n","“There was a moment or two there during the pandemic, just wondering about our timing,” she said. “But nothing serious, and it really didn’t have anything to do with the water. This is just a great place to live.”\n","\n","Heading toward the sea, visitors pass a patchwork baseball diamond, unwatered since the last rains. Art galleries and restaurants along the main strip in town are busy with masked tourists.\n","\n","The Highlight Gallery is fairly typical.

For several years, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has pushed the idea that he and his company shouldn’t be in the position of creating the rules of the road to govern the personal expression of billions of people. He went so far as to dedicate $130 million to fund an independent panel of outside experts to which the company could outsource the thorniest decisions about what types of content — and voices — should be allowed to stay up on Facebook.\n","\n","When the company banned Trump on Jan. 6 for social media posts encouraging the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, Zuckerberg turned that hard decision over to that newly formed independent panel, the Oversight Board, for review, hoping it would make the final determination.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","But on Wednesday, the 20-member panel punted the decision back to Facebook, recommending the company decide within six months whether to permanently ban or restore Trump’s account. He is currently suspended “indefinitely,” a one-off penalty outside Facebook’s usual rules.\n","\n","The board, set up to act as a “Supreme Court-like” body to police Facebook’s content decisions, scolded the company for trying to pass it off, too.\n","\n","“In applying a vague, standardless penalty and then referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities,” the members wrote in a sharply worded ruling. “The Board declines Facebook’s request and insists that Facebook apply and justify a defined penalty.”\n","\n","The long-awaited decision by the board Wednesday was widely expected to settle Trump’s fate on the site, as well as provide guidance to other social media companies like YouTube that have also suspended Trump’s accounts.

Nick Clegg, Facebook‘s vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a blog post Wednesday that it will “consider the board’s decision and determine an action that is clear and proportionate.” Because its recommendations that Facebook restore or block Trump permanently are nonbinding, it’s unclear whether the company will follow them.\n","\n","Facebook’s Oversight Board upheld the ban on former president Donald Trump, a test case of social media companies’ power to moderate inflammatory speech.

They have to follow their own rules.”\n","\n","The decision that caused the rift was announced Wednesday after months of deliberation. Facebook‘s Oversight Board said it was upholding the company’s ban on Trump.\n","\n","In the ruling, the board agreed that Trump’s comments on the day of the Capitol insurrection “created an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible.” The board pointed to the president’s references to the rioters as “patriots” and “special,” and his instructions to “Remember this day forever.”\n","\n","But it took issue with Facebook’s “indefinite” suspension of Trump, saying it was “vague and uncertain.” The board said Facebook’s rationale for the original ban was unprincipled and arbitrary, and that “indefinite” bans were not even written policy at the time the Trump decision was made.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","When sending the case back to Facebook, the board recommended that the company come up with a better, clearer rationale for either banning or restoring Trump’s account.\n","\n","Trump, for his part, said in a statement Wednesday that free speech was taken from him because “Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth.”\n","\n","Trump advisers viewed the Oversight Board decision as disappointing because it could hurt fundraising prospects going forward, said one adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about internal deliberations.\n","\n","News of the decision was rare cause for optimism among Facebook’s workforce, which has been demoralized by the company’s many scandals and history of giving passes to Trump.

YouTube has also suspended Trump’s account indefinitely but says it could reinstate him when it judges the threat of him inciting political violence has abated. The Google-owned video site froze Trump’s channel after it uploaded videos of him doubling down on comments he had made to supporters before the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Usually breaking YouTube’s rules for the first time results in a one-week suspension, but Trump’s account has been locked for about four months now.\n","\n","“At YouTube, we have long-established community guidelines that govern what can stay on our platform and apply to everyone,” said YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi. “The Donald J. Trump channel violated our incitement-to-violence policy and was suspended in accordance with our three-strikes system.”\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Trump wasn’t as active on YouTube as he was on Facebook and Twitter, but the video platform was a major part of his campaign’s advertising strategy. Trump bought millions of dollars’ worth of ads on YouTube throughout the election and secured the coveted homepage banner ad during the Democratic National Convention and the week leading up to the election.\n","\n","Twitter, which got out of the business of political advertising before the 2020 election, banned Trump permanently after the Capitol insurrection.\n","\n","Facebook is also a critical part of many political campaigns, offering a way for candidates to connect with potential voters and to raise funds.\n","\n","“Twitter was probably a greater personal loss [to Trump], but Facebook is a more important professional loss,” said social media researcher and Clemson University professor Darren Linvill. “It’s central to any campaign.”\n","\n","Zuckerberg first publicly floated the idea of creating the Oversight Board in 2018, just as lawmakers around the world were mulling ways to regulate the social network. Critics said the company lacked any accountability for its moderation decisions, from handling hate speech to how it applied its newsworthiness exemption to leaders like Trump. They said there were no checks on Zuckerberg’s power to determine what could be shared with billions of people. Each major decision could have wide-reaching social consequences, the kind that are regularly handled by laws and courts around the world. So Facebook decided to make its own court, outside of any existing legal system, staffed by paid experts and with no legal authority to force Facebook to change.\n","\n","“You can imagine some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don’t work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world,” Zuckerberg told Vox in a 2018 interview.\n","\n","The actual board didn’t come together until last year. It started working on its first decision in the fall, its 20 members meeting over videoconference. Since late January, the board has heard 10 cases and ruled nine times, filing long legal-like documents that contain a binding ruling on whether to uphold a Facebook moderation decision, along with policy suggestions that Facebook can choose to implement or not. In six cases, it has gone against Facebook’s initial determination.\n","\n","Samuel Woolley, an assistant professor and the director of a propaganda research team at the University of Texas at Austin, said Wednesday’s decision is further indication that the government needs to step in and regulate this space.\n","\n","The board was right to insist on more transparency, he said.\n","\n","“The board is essentially saying, ‘We can’t do our jobs if Facebook doesn’t have clear internal regulations, and we’re not going to be a scapegoat for Facebook’s decisions.’”\n","\n","Gerrit De Vynck, Rachel Lerman and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.\n","\n","GiftOutline Gift Article\n","[] 2021-06-25 00:00:00 Placeholder while article actions load\n","\n","When 18-year-old Bryce Dershem stepped up to the lectern at his New Jersey high school’s graduation ceremony last week, he wanted to share how his battle with mental health was made even more difficult in a senior year marred by the coronavirus pandemic.

The stated purpose was often that they disagreed with specific language in the legislation — particularly that the riot constituted an “insurrection.”\n","\n","But increasingly, key elements of the conservative movement have expressed another relevant objection involving Capitol Police officers’ conduct that day: suggesting Ashli Babbitt was a martyr.\n","\n","Babbitt was the 35-year-old veteran whom a Capitol Police officer shot and killed while she was breaking into a sensitive area of the Capitol. In April, the Capitol Police officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing in the shooting. But of late, pressing for answers on Babbitt’s death has become a cause celebre among some conservative activists.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","What’s perhaps most notable about the effort is how slowly it has built. We had the graphic video of Babbitt’s death almost immediately after the Capitol riot. Very little has been added to the record since then, beyond the officer’s being cleared two months ago. But as the questioning of the narrative of the Capitol riot has grown — and with authorities still declining to identify the officer involved — a chorus has swelled around the Babbitt issue as well.\n","\n","Shortly after the Capitol riot, Babbitt’s death was often held up on the right as a tragedy, but not necessarily one resulting from police misconduct or political persecution.\n","\n","Then-Fox Business host Lou Dobbs on Jan. 7 lamented Babbitt’s death but suggested that a backlash wasn’t likely or necessary.\n","\n","“Does anyone on the left this evening seriously believe the death of Ashli Babbitt at the hands of a Capitol Police officer justifies civil unrest for even a few minutes, or certainly months afterwards?” Dobbs said. “I do not. I don’t know anyone who does.”\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","On Jan. 9, Fox News contributor Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent, was asked specifically about how the Babbitt situation was handled, and he warned against “Monday morning quarterbacking.”\n","\n","“Well, in general, there are two big failures I see here that are obvious,” Bongino said. “Let me just say this, of course, it is always going to be Monday morning quarterbacking. I mean, there’s no other easy way to put it.”\n","\n","Indeed, at that point, there were few efforts to claim any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death.\n","\n","The next month, though, that began to change. Fox host Tucker Carlson responded to a Nicholas Kristof column noting Babbitt was a viewer of Carlson’s show, which often featured the kind of baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud that spurred the Capitol rioters. Carlson leaned into the idea that perhaps Babbitt shouldn’t have been shot.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","“But what kind of country is it where nobody says, ‘Well, wait, that’s kind of sad,’” Carlson said. “They shot an unarmed woman? Is that really a death-penalty offense?”\n","\n","But it was still months before the effort to suggest Babbitt’s shooting might have been wrong truly took off.\n","\n","After the officer was cleared in April, Carlson lamented that “when you’re fighting insurrectionists, you don’t have to explain yourself; you just hyperventilate about QAnon and then you do whatever you want.”\n","\n","Carlson also upped the ante when it came to pitching the likes of Babbitt and her fellow rioters as tragic figures: “When a group of sad, disenfranchised people who have been left out of the modern economy show up at your office, you don’t have to listen to their complaints.”\n","\n","He also labeled the death a “homicide” — a word that implies criminality by the shooter: “Only one person actually was a homicide victim. That was Ashli Babbitt. She was a protester.”\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","By May, the theory that Babbitt’s death was wrong gained a supporter in Congress, with Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) going so far as to claim at a hearing with FBI Director Christopher A. Wray that Babbitt was “executed.” (This was the hearing in which other Republicans who would eventually vote against the Congressional Gold Medals would also downplay the riot, including Georgia Rep. Andrew S. Clyde, who said early images of Trump supporters streaming into the Capitol looked like a “normal tourist visit.”)\n","\n","Gosar this week doubled down on the “executed” claim, adding that the police officer was “lying in wait.” This drew a rebuke from Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who said it was “disgusting and despicable to see Gosar lie about that day and smear the men and women who defended us.”\n","\n","On January 6, as the violent mob advanced on the House chamber, I was standing near @RepGosar and helped him open his gas mask.

It is disgusting and despicable to see Gosar lie about that day and smear the men and women who defended us. https://t.co/GKsnekHBKx — Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) June 16, 2021\n","\n","Fox’s Laura Ingraham has also increasingly dabbled in this. On Jan. 6, she conducted a sympathetic but largely fact-focused interview with an eyewitness to the shooting. The witness said of Babbitt: “She wasn’t being violent; she wasn’t breaking anything. She just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Between then and now, Ingraham occasionally mentioned Babbitt as the only shooting victim of the riot — a regular argument to suggest the situation wasn’t actually that violent. But this month, Ingraham has repeatedly run segments calling for answers.\n","\n","Fox News host Mark Levin last week described Babbitt as essentially someone minding her own business when she was shot.\n","\n","“The only person killed that day was this veteran who was in the building, who didn’t have a weapon, who wasn’t threatening anybody,” Levin said. “She was walking around with the rest, and boom.”\n","\n","(Babbitt was, in fact, climbing through a broken window of doors that officers were struggling mightily to keep closed to rioters.)\n","\n","Carlson this week cited Russian President Vladimir Putin as having raised valid concerns about Babbitt’s death. (Whatever one thinks about the circumstances of her death, Putin’s record on human rights makes pretty clear this is less about justice and more about deflection.)\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","And social media has practically exploded this week with fringe conservative figures — who have real followings — suggesting that Babbitt was a patriot who was unjustly killed.\n","\n","It’s all a logical progression of the effort to recast the Jan. 6 riot, for two reasons:\n","\n","It contributes to the narrative that it wasn’t that bad — and even that these were simply well-meaning protesters trying to make their voices heard It raises claims of a double standard and hypocrisy when it comes to police shootings. (“Well, we certainly didn’t hear that when the tables were turned,” Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson said on Levin’s show . “Again, it’s the concern about the unequal application of justice and a lot of concern.”)\n","\n","And for those reasons, the chorus seems likely to keep growing. Thus far, it’s mostly relegated to social media, fringe members like Gosar and conservative talkers (who pitch this as just raising questions, while being sympathetic to Babbitt).

A key question we examined was whether Hunter Biden, President Biden’s son, arranged for a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm to meet with the then-vice president when he was in charge of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. The date in question: April 16, 2015.\n","\n","A campaign spokesman for Joe Biden had said a review of Biden’s schedule for that day found no record of any such meeting. Officials who worked for him in 2015 also told The Fact Checker that no such meeting took place.\n","\n","Recently, a reader directed our attention to a May 26 New York Post report, featuring more emails, that was headlined: “Hunter Biden brought VP Joe to dinner with shady business partners.” The article suggested Joe Biden met with the Burisma executive, Vadym Pozharskyi, at a dinner that was held in the private “garden room” at Cafe Milano in Washington.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","The reader, in a phone message, said it was time to update our report because new details had emerged from the laptop about the vice president’s movements that day. As the New York Post put it, “The dinner raises questions about how much Joe Biden, who has claimed ignorance of his son’s activities, knew about Hunter’s dealings with foreign businesses and government officials.”\n","\n","But when we looked into it, there was less to the story than one might imagine.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","A few hours earlier, Joe Biden had made remarks at the White House Greek Independence Day Reception, according to his official schedule. He and Karloutsos are personal friends who have known each other for 40 years. Karloutsos’s wife, Xanthi, is on the board of the Beau Biden Foundation, which fights child abuse. (Beau Biden, who had an aggressive form of brain cancer, died a few weeks after this dinner.)\n","\n","Joe Biden, a Roman Catholic, also has a long history of working with the Greek Orthodox Church. In 2015, the church awarded him the Patriarch Athenagoras Humanitarian Award. “This may be the greatest honor I’ve ever received in my public life,” he declared.\n","\n","Leach recalled that the dinner involved about 10 to 12 people in a private room but that Joe Biden “didn’t even sit down. He was not part of the dinner or part of the dinner discussion.” Instead, he just spoke to Karloutsos.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Karloutsos, in an email, confirmed Leach’s account. “That is true. It was very kind of the then VP to do so.”\n","\n","Leach described Hunter Biden as an active board chairman of WFP USA. He said the two of them had a “tag-team presentation” as they made a pitch at various events for food assistance. One Hunter Biden email before the dinner remarked that “the reason for the dinner is ostensibly to discuss food security,” the New York Post said. But Leach said that was indeed the focus of the discussion. At the dinner, “there was no discussion of politics or business about anything or anywhere,” he said.\n","\n","Leach said he found the introduction to Karloutsos to be helpful and he later followed up with a meeting in New York. At the time, Greece was flooded with refugees from Syria and Leach was eager to get the church involved. The New York Post article quotes an email from Leach to Hunter Biden later that night: “What a fantastic and productive evening — thank you!”\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","One mystery is why the drop-by was not listed on Joe Biden’s schedule. Not everything is always listed on a presidential or vice-presidential schedule. But the New York Post quotes from an email from Hunter Biden to Karloutsos’s son, Michael, on March 26: “Dad will be there but keep that between us for now.”\n","\n","A White House individual with knowledge of Joe Biden’s schedules said the decision to see Father Alex was made late that day, after the schedule was completed.

So it’s still unclear how the vice president could have met him, unless he was a last-minute addition. (Alex Karloutsos also is not included on that early list.) The Biden campaign, after a comprehensive review, had said a meeting never took place between Joe Biden and Pozharskyi.

The likelihood is they would have pulled back even more, and the building would have been trashed more,” Mr. Elder said Friday on a podcast.\n","\n","He cited studies, including three from Washington State University, showing that police are actually less likely to use force against Black suspects, a reverse-racism finding that has been attributed to fears about legal, social and media backlash.\n","\n","“What happened was horrific enough without somehow playing a thought experiment of what would have happened if the protesters had been mostly Black,” Mr. Elder said.\n","\n","Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, said that no such speculation is necessary, given the lessons from last year’s Black Lives Matter unrest, which saw major U.S. cities beset for months by burning, looting and rioting among protests that typically began peacefully before erupting into violence.\n","\n","“We don’t need to speculate about how they’d be treated,” Mr. Kirsanow said in an email. “We saw months of rioting, arson, and looting over the summer. Dozens of people killed, billions in property damage, entire neighborhoods wrecked, police stations and other government buildings taken over. Yet in multiple jurisdictions cops were ordered to stand down.”\n","\n","In Minneapolis, for example, police were ordered by the city to abandon a precinct station, allowing it to be torched by rioters, while in Seattle, protesters were permitted to take over for weeks a six-block “autonomous zone” and declare it off limits to law enforcement.\n","\n","Derrick Wilburn, head of Rocky Mountain Black Conservatives, accused Democrats of reflexively playing the race card with “entirely unnecessary comments impugning the Washington, D.C., police,” adding that “when you’re seeking racism constantly, you’re constantly finding racism, even where none exists.”\n","\n","Charges of racially biased disparate treatment erupted within hours of the Capitol rioting, spurred by video showing protesters walking through the Rotunda unimpeded and a clip of a rioter sidling up next to an officer and taking a selfie.\n","\n","Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said that “we witnessed two systems of justice when we saw one that let extremists storm the United States Capitol, and another that released tear gas on peaceful protesters last summer.”\n","\n","In fact, police did deploy tear gas in the Senate chambers and outside the Capitol building, where they also used percussion grenades to disperse pro-Trump rioters toward the end of the four-hour siege, The Associated Press reported.\n","\n","CNN columnist Roxanne Jones said Thursday in a op-ed that “[t]his is what it looks like when toxic White privilege is left unchecked and consistently encouraged by our nation’s leaders,” while NBA star LeBron James cited a June 1 photo of an officer pointing a rubber-bullet gun at or near a Black man with a toddler on his shoulders amid looting in Long Beach, California.\n","\n","“We’ve all seen that photo.

Big Tech and other critics condemn it as a safe space for insurrectionists, though Parler’s supporters herald it as the last vestige of free speech on the internet.\n","\n","Parler resembles the rival Twitter, hosting microblogging posts, aka Parleys.\n","\n","The company’s use of a less-restrictive censorship regime attracted new scrutiny after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Google and Apple removed Parler from their app stores, and Amazon Web Services took Parler offline.\n","\n","Critics also accuse Parler of data mining: Collecting extensive information about users that can be used for commercial or political purposes.\n","\n","According to a cached version of Parler’s privacy policy updated in December, Parler said it collected a wide swath of personal information that included Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers and much more.\n","\n","“Parler’s collection of highly sensitive information like Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses to enable certain features is pretty far outside the norm for social media platforms and not something you see on Twitter or Facebook,” said Zach Graves, policy chief at Lincoln Network, a nonprofit group focused on bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington.\n","\n","“This is something you might [see] where there’s a good regulatory compliance reason, such as showing your driver’s license to get an account on ZipCar, or similarly on platforms like DraftKings or PredictIt to verify your identity for payments. But there’s no good reason for Parler to collect this information to, say, enable direct messages.”\n","\n","Parler did not respond to The Washington Times’ questions about data mining.\n","\n","For Parler’s fans, the freedom from censorship often trumps privacy concerns.\n","\n","Big Tech’s battle with Parler has won it many conservative allies, including Internet Accountability Project founder Mike Davis, who wants government intervention to dismantle the tech companies’ dominance in the marketplace.\n","\n","“Big Tech monopolists collude to cancel conservatives, tell us to ‘build your own’ social media platforms, and they collude to kill those like they are doing to Parler,” Mr. Davis said. “Big Tech is a clear and present danger to the free market and free speech.”\n","\n","Much about Parler — the name is the French verb “to speak” — is untraditional. The company was born outside the Silicon Valley pipelines that created the major social media players.\n","\n","The Parler app went live in 2018 as the brainchild of software engineer John Matze, Parler’s CEO, and conservative donor Rebekah Mercer. The hard launch to attract users coincided with the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington.\n","\n","A Parler representative was scheduled to speak at CPAC, but the company instead opted to work the corridors of power in Washington to attract big-name allies.\n","\n","On the Tuesday after CPAC weekend, Parler invited Trump administration officials, lawmakers, activists, journalists and others to a private briefing featuring Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, in the Russell Senate Office Building.\n","\n","The Las Vegas-based company’s outreach to Washington heavyweights put it on conservatives’ radars, but its foothold on the right solidified in the summer. The site had an influx of 100,000 users in one day in June, including high-profile conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, after pro-Trump voice @CarpeDonktum was banned by Twitter and surfaced on Parler.\n","\n","Parler simultaneously sought to attract liberals but failed miserably.\n","\n","Parler offered a $20,000 bounty for a blue-check-marked Twitter figure with 50,000 or more followers who identified as a liberal to join Parler. While several users applied, no one met Parler’s terms and the company ended the offer, said Parler Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Wernick.\n","\n","Unable to make inroads on the left, Parler became the digital refuge for supporters of President Trump who were angry with Facebook and Twitter’s crackdowns on the president and his supporters and news stories that portrayed Joseph R. Biden in a negative light.\n","\n","Twitter took action against 40 of Mr. Trump’s posts in a seven-day span after the election. Facebook and Twitter restricted the distribution of news stories about foreign business deals by Mr. Biden’s son.\n","\n","The fallout from Facebook and Twitter’s crackdown drove millions of people to Parler, pushing the app atop Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store in the days after the election. Approximately 4.5 million users flocked to Parler during the weekend after the November election alone, according to the company.\n","\n","Parler’s networks were strained, and Mr. Matze, whose growing team numbered approximately 20 staffers last summer, was happy with the headache. Parler had long spoiled for a fight with Big Tech, and it was beginning to make waves.\n","\n","Mr. Matze’s October prediction that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s social media model “will lose within three years” to Parler had barely registered in the tech community. Facebook said it had 196 million daily active users in the U.S. and Canada during 2020’s third quarter, and Twitter said it had 152 million users in the U.S. during the same time frame.\n","\n","Still, Parler’s sharp user growth drew attention. It also drew criticism. Liberal opponents of Mr. Trump accused Parler’s users of participating in the riot at the Capitol. The Southern Poverty Law Center labeled Parler a “haven for far-right extremism” and a “haven for recruitment and promotion for the Jan. 6 pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol building.”\n","\n","Many users in the Parler community were nowhere near the Capitol.\n","\n","Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming were the states that had the most users relative to their populations, according to a study by Global Wireless Solutions. GWS relied on an opt-in panel of 75,000 to 100,000 consumers that measured Android smartphone users’ mobile app usage and content, network performance and consumer perceptions.\n","\n","GWS found Parler users are more likely to be White, 45 or older and upper-middle-class (based on college education and a six-figure income) than the national average.\n","\n","The dominant personality trait among the Parler users was their decision to turn off Fox News. According to GWS data, Parler users spent more time on the NewsMax App than the FoxNews App after Election Day. Before the election, they rarely, if ever, used NewsMax’s app.\n","\n","Parler is now locking horns with Amazon in federal court and working to get its website fully back online. Parler’s users are still searching for a digital home, but Signal, a secure messaging application, and Telegram, a cloud-based messaging platform, have both reported influxes of users in recent days.\n","\n","Whether Parler has a next chapter will be determined by who authors the internet’s rules. If the Big Tech companies that deleted Parler remain in charge, then prospects for the company’s return in its previous form look dim. If lawmakers and regulators intervene to write new guidelines, Parler may need to play by a different set of rules before getting back onto the field.\n","\n","Rep.

Absent such a declaration, a denial of such access would be grounds for the removal of any military officer. The same is true for the exercise of other executive privileges and powers,” Mr. Turley said.\n","\n","Similarly, Ilya Shapiro, the publisher of the Cato Institute’s Supreme Court Review, found Ms. Pelosi’s statement to present legal trouble unless she does pursue impeachment, which she has hinted could come next week.\n","\n","“It’s definitely a problem. Until and unless the president is removed, either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment, he remains the commander-in-chief. Given Pelosi’s statement, either she’s proceeding with impeachment or she’s setting a dangerous precedent for disrupting the civilian chain of command,” Mr. Shapiro said.\n","\n","Democrats have been pushing for Mr. Trump to be impeached a second time, arguing that he incited his supporters to break into the Capitol in a violent riot that ended with multiple people dead.

Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia Republican. The talks fell apart over an unwillingness by Republicans to compromise on raising taxes and Mr. Biden‘s insistence on including social welfare and climate change spending in the package.\n","\n","After the breakdown, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has jumped into the fray hoping to forge a consensus on their own. The group, which has no ties to congressional leadership, counts among its members both moderate Democrats and Republicans.\n","\n","“We began working weeks ago and we’ve got Republicans and Democrats that agree, pretty much down to dollars and cents,” Mr. Romney said.\n","\n","Most of Mr. Romney’s colleagues take a dim view of the effort. Mr. Biden‘s team, they warn, could strike a watered-down compromise on infrastructure just to be able to say they achieved a bipartisan deal. Mr. Biden could then get the rest of what he wants passed via budget reconciliation, a process that allows spending bills to pass the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes.\n","\n","The upshot: Mr. Biden, who campaigned on a pledge to restore bipartisanship in Washington, claims credit for staying true to his promise while simultaneously delivering a liberal wishlist of spending for his party’s progressive base.\n","\n","Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, hinted at the strategy by promising to begin the reconciliation process regardless of how bipartisan talks go.\n","\n","“I don’t know why any Republican would want to help Democrats further mortgage our children’s future in that manner,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who is openly skeptical of the dealmaking now underway.\n","\n","Such concerns are one of the reasons why it is unclear if the new negotiations will draw enough Republican support to overcome a likely filibuster in the Senate, which is split 50-50 between the parties.\n","\n","The membership of the bipartisan group is fluid but several Senate Republicans are involved. The effort is being led on the Republican side by Mr. Romney and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and on the Democratic side by Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n","\n","Mr. Romney and Mr. Portman are convinced they have more leverage than Democrats want to admit.\n","\n","A Republican source close to the negotiations noted that Democrats are not assured they can pass the package through the reconciliation process, which would require support from all 50 Democratic senators. And the rest of Mr. Biden’s plan is tax hikes that will be difficult to get through the House and Senate.\n","\n","Notably absent from the group are the moderate Republicans who are most likely to support a deal such as Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Mr. Toomey, in particular, is seen as a key swing vote and is not seeking reelection in 2022.\n","\n","Mr. Romney admitted that rounding up additional support from other Republican senators was required before moving forward.\n","\n","“We’ve met with a number of additional members of the Republican group and talked through the various line items,” he said. “We’re in a good place and we’ll see whether there’s support from a sufficient number of Republicans to make this interesting to the White House and Democrats.”\n","\n","Complicating matters is that many believe if Ms. Capito and members of GOP leadership were unable to cut a deal with the White House, the new bipartisan group is unlikely to do better from the Republican standpoint.\n","\n","The White House initially proposed spending about $2.25 trillion on infrastructure, with most of the money earmarked for social welfare and combating climate change. Republicans balked at the sum, arguing that any infrastructure package should focus exclusively on repairing the nation’s roads and bridges.\n","\n","Eventually, Mr. Biden trimmed his request down to $1.7 trillion, but both sides remained far apart on how to pay for the spending.\n","\n","The White House wanted to pay for the package by raising business and income taxes or at the very least imposing a 15% minimum tax on corporations. Republicans opposed tax increases, arguing in favor of repurposing unused coronavirus relief funds.\n","\n","Mr. Romney’s group is eyeing a spending package closer to the Republican final offer than to Mr. Biden‘s. Although not yet finalized, the bipartisan senators propose spending upwards of $900 billion exclusively on transportation systems.\n","\n","They also hope to accomplish the deal without hiking corporate or income taxes. It is uncertain, though, if the White House will accept that position. Mr. Biden opted to walk away from the negotiations led by Ms. Capito over the GOP’s unwillingness to support any tax increases.\n","\n","“There is bipartisan support for needed investment in our nation’s infrastructure.

The bill is highly unlikely to go anywhere without filibuster reform, as it would need 60 votes to pass and there’s currently no public Senate GOP support. However, it’s another big step towards potential representation for the District. Should the filibuster be eliminated, the measure would only need a simple majority (which the Democrats currently have) to pass.\n","\n","The Congressional politics of DC statehood have changed a bit over the years. Not long ago, it was presented primarily as a civil rights issue—the unfinished business of the civil rights movement, a majority-Black city denied equal rights. Though the District’s demographics have changed, that argument about basic fairness remains part of the mix.

The Bethesda man had been found guilty in the fiery 2017 tunnel death of Silver Spring resident Askia Khafra. Beckwitt was also convicted of involuntary manslaughter, which the appeals court did not overturn. He will now face a new sentencing, and the ruling means that he could end up doing less time (he is currently serving a nine-year sentence).\n","\n","The bizarre case was chronicled in an in-depth 2019 Washingtonian story.

The pandemic has only raised the stakes: In 2020, according to Feil, Americans wagered $21 billion, a 62 percent increase over 2019. Fans stuck at home, she says, are “using sports betting as a way to engage with sports.”\n","\n","Homebound local bettors are in luck. DC, which legalized sports gambling in 2018, now offers two ways to place bets—not just in person, but also online. And Virginia rolled out new betting apps last month. Here’s a guide to how the sports-betting process works here.\n","\n","First of all, what sports can I bet on?\n","\n","DC allows bets on professional and college football, basketball, baseball, soccer, hockey, and many other sports. There are some limitations, however. Bets on horse racing are not allowed, and you can’t bet on any college game that takes place within the District.\n","\n","Similarly, in Virginia, you can’t place a bet on in-state college games. And you can’t place a sports bet at all in Maryland: The state has legalized sports betting, but has not opened any sportsbooks as of yet. Betting licenses are likely to be approved later this year or in early 2022.\n","\n","How can I place a bet in DC?\n","\n","One option is to go to the William Hill Sportsbook inside Capital One Arena. Once there, you can either physically place your bet or use their app.\n","\n","The other choice is to use the GambetDC app, which was rolled out last May by the DC Lottery. In order to place a bet, you have to be 18 years old and physically in the District. You also can’t bet while on federal property, such as at the Washington Monument or Lincoln Memorial.\n","\n","BetMGM Sportsbook is slated to open at Nats Park this summer, and FanDuel Sportsbook is opening at Audi Field later this year.\n","\n","Feil says DC is giving consumers multiple options for where and how to place a bet—including “bringing betting to where sports fans are” at stadiums—unlike in other states, where most betting happens in casinos.\n","\n","Still, revenue from gambling has fallen short of projections, largely due to pandemic shutdowns and the sometimes confusing Gambet app, according to a Washington Post article in September. The Post reported that the city lowered its anticipated revenue from $28 million to $12 million for this fiscal year. According to Feil, DC so far has made $3 million.\n","\n","Can I go to a local bar to place a bet?\n","\n","Not yet. Hotels, bars, and restaurants have to apply for a Class B license, and none have been approved to date. This has been a source of controversy in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, where residents have opposed the opening of a sports-betting facility at the bar Handle 19. Because there is no mechanism to block a gambling license, the neighborhood is targeting the bar’s liquor license. The effort has so far proven successful, since Handle 19 has repeatedly delayed its opening. But the bar’s owner, Shane August, insists he’ll open with or without the liquor license.\n","\n","How can I place a bet in Virginia?\n","\n","Virginia started up several betting apps last month. FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, BetRivers, and William Hill sportsbooks are now approved for use in the state.*\n","\n","Now I’m ready to place a bet. How does it work?\n","\n","First, choose a game or a fight. Then, decide how you want to bet. One option is to take the money line, which means picking a team to win, no matter the score. Another way is to bet against the spread, meaning choosing a team based on how many more points they score against their opponent. For example, as of this writing, the Chiefs are favored over the Buccaneers by 3 points.* So if you take that bet and they win by four or more points, you win. If the Chiefs lose or win by fewer than three points, you lose. If they win by exactly three points, you get your money back.\n","\n","A third option is to bet on the over/under, meaning the total number of points scored in the game. For the Super Bowl, the over/under is 57.5. You can choose whether you think there will be 58 points or more (the over), or 57 points or less (the under).\n","\n","Which option will win you the most money is largely dependent on the sport, the game, and your comfort with risk.\n","\n","Help! I’m still confused by some of these betting terms.\n","\n","Not to worry! Here’s a brief glossary of some of the more common lingo:\n","\n","Covering the spread: Winning when you bet against the point spread.\n","\n","Hedging: Betting on both sides to limit your losses or guarantee a profit.\n","\n","Line: Another name for the spread.\n","\n","Odds: The ratio of how much money you can win to how much you put down. For example, if the odds are 5-1, that means you can win five dollars for every dollar you bet (plus your initial payment). So if you bet $10 at those odds, and win, you would win $60.\n","\n","Parlay: Betting on multiple games at once. You have to win each game, meaning these are high-risk but high-reward.\n","\n","Prop bet: Any bet on something other than the outcome of the game. The over/under is a popular one. A common Super Bowl prop bet is the length of the national anthem.\n","\n","Vigorish (or vig): The fee taken by the bookie or gambling house on a bet. Most commonly, the sportsbook will take about 10 cents per dollar bet, but the vig varies among sportsbooks, so keep it in mind when deciding where to place your bet.\n","\n","Gambling can be addictive. Does DC have safeguards to prevent risky behavior?\n","\n","DC relies heavily on self-management. For example, you can set limits on bet amounts and time spent in the app. You can also voluntarily exclude yourself from gambling activities for a certain amount of time.\n","\n","Feil says these measures are a “good start.” Consumers like to set their own limits, she says, and sportsbooks often have specialists who are trained to identify problematic gambling behaviors, both in person and electronically.\n","\n","*This post has been corrected and updated.\n","['Andrew Beaujon'] 2020-12-21 00:00:00 On January 6, Congress will receive the electoral college votes that certified Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.

The point is, the fact-checkers have spoken, and “chumps” isn’t the new “basket of deplorables.”\n","\n","Then, when the same ruckus-causing happened at a Biden event Friday in St. Paul, Minnesota, the Democratic presidential nominee did the exact same thing, since apparently history doesn’t repeat itself over generations or ages nowadays, it repeats itself over the period of less than a week.\n","\n","There are two problems with Biden’s drive-in rallies. First, even though there’s the novelty and social distancing aspect baked in, you see the kind of crowds World TeamTennis used to draw.\n","\n","In Toledo, Ohio, Biden set up a drive-in rally at a local United Auto Workers plant earlier this month.

However, we agree that America is the greatest nation the world has ever seen, and thus, we believe that America has an important role to play as a force for liberty and justice on the world stage.”\n","\n","In an interview with NPR on Tuesday, Rice said that relationship continues.\n","\n","“I have a 23-year-old son whom I love dearly, whose politics are very, very different from my own and from the rest of our family,” she said. “My son and I will have some robust disagreements over some matters of policy, not all. And yet, at the end of the day, you know, I love him dearly and he loves me.”\n","\n","And, get this, they actually seem to find areas of agreement — something she told NPR the country could learn from.\n","\n","“We agree, for example, on the importance of the United States playing a responsible, principled leadership role in the world,” Rice said.\n","\n","“We agree on the importance of having strong alliances. We agree we have to be cleareyed and strong in dealing with adversaries like Russia and the threat that China may pose. We disagree on things like choice. I’m pro-choice. He’s pro-life.

He’s a piece of s—.”\n","\n","Of course, these aren’t the only problems that Rice presents.\n","\n","The biggest is Benghazi, where Rice was one of the main people who blamed the 2012 terrorist attack on our consulate in the Libyan city on a poorly produced internet video when the Obama administration knew full well the act was a pre-planned terrorist attack.\n","\n","Rice even on the Sunday shows in the days after the attack to give that explanation. In a book released last fall, Fox News noted, she again blamed Hillary Clinton and the CIA talking points she was given.\n","\n","Even assuming the truth of that, her nomination would still eat into the Biden narrative, which will no doubt emphasize the happy-clappy parts of the Obama years.

Then, shortly after announcing his run, his campaign blasted out thousands of fundraising emails and the online money started to roll in, which he juiced by making rounds on the talk show circuit.\n","\n","Within about three days, he reached the magic $1 million figure — and his campaign issued a news release.\n","\n","The fundraising effort was described by two Inslee aides who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the inner workings of his campaign.\n","\n","Michael Duncan, a Republican digital strategist, said numbers posted by lesser-known candidates are likely to be less grassroots and more “the campaign equivalent of AstroTurf.” But Duncan, who formerly handled digital strategy for the insurgent tea party group FreedomWorks, said it was a shrewd tactic. Particularly now that the Democratic National Committee is using online fundraising, with an emphasis on low-dollar contributions spread out across many donors to qualify for the debate stage.\n","\n","“I would imagine the grassroots support is manufactured,” said Duncan, who also was an architect of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s digital strategy in 2015. “I’d doubt they’d own a file of hundreds of thousands of Americans dying to give them $10.”\n","\n","Most campaigns won’t offer specifics on how they reached their mark.

Influenza is a respiratory virus, most likely transmitted at least in part via airborne particles, and airplanes have recirculation, air filtration, and fresh-air injection systems burly enough to purge cabins of smoke if there’s a fire. They ought to do the same with a virus. So how’d those people get sick? That’s the interesting part.\n","\n","The flight made a stop on the way, in Homer, where a new passenger came on board. That person, the “index case,” had the flu. The 737 took off, but an engine problem forced it to return to the airport. There it waited—engines off, on the tarmac. Some passengers stayed on board; some waited in the terminal. Eventually, other planes took the stranded passengers on to their destinations, where nearly three-quarters eventually became sick with the flu as well—“secondary infections.” Almost all of them were the ones who’d spent their unplanned layover on the plane with the sick passenger rather than in the terminal.\n","\n","That choice—where they waited—was the crux. With the engines off, the 737’s air conditioner wasn’t working. The airplane cabin turned into the classic indoor, crowded, low-ventilation space you really want to avoid if you don’t want to pick up a respiratory virus like the flu—or, more relevantly today, Covid-19.\n","\n","It might not seem like it, but this story is actually good evidence for why it’s hard to get sick on an airplane, although folk wisdom might suggest otherwise. If everyone’s wearing a mask and the ventilation is blowing, it is indeed difficult to get Covid-19 when you fly.\n","\n","But it’s not impossible. And that’s where things get complicated.\n","\n","As most of the United States tips back into uncontrolled spread of the pandemic virus, with just a week before the traditional holiday travel season begins, it’d be nice to know: How risky are airplanes, exactly? The short answer is: No one knows, but risky enough. If you can avoid flying, avoid it. “The position that a lot of airline executives are stating now, publicly—that the risk is essentially zero—is just unrealistic,” says David Freedman, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who studies travel medicine. “I’m not saying the risk is high. And the risk is manageable. But to start from the position that the risk is zero on an airplane is like the politicians who are saying this is a hoax. It exists.”\n","\n","This position isn’t perhaps the sexiest. “Low-ish risk but nonzero, avoid unless you can’t” bears some explaining.\n","\n","Most scientists and health care workers now agree that the virus that causes Covid-19 can travel through the air, borne aloft in teeny globs of snot. Even people without symptoms can emit these particles, just by talking or breathing. Masks can stop some of them, though probably not all—but hey, nobody really knows how many you have to inhale to get sick, either. Another thing that helps prevent infection is being far enough away from people that whatever virus they’re giving off gets diluted before it gets to you; even better is being outside.\n","['Condé Nast', 'Adam Rogers'] 2020-08-06 11:00:00+00:00 The idea seems pretty simple, once someone explains it. The virus that causes the pandemic disease Covid-19 passes from human to human on tiny droplets of spittle, through the air. Masks block some of them. But what if—and I am literally spitballing here—you could clean those particles from the air itself?\n","\n","Researchers who study aerosols and indoor air quality have (mostly) (finally) convinced the scientific establishment—the World Health Organization, the US Department of Health and Human Services—that Covid-19 transmission has an airborne component. And now some of those same aerosol specialists have begun to think this ventilation approach is a good idea. A big, complicated central air system filled with filters and maybe even germ-busting ultraviolet light, like what a hospital or skyscraper might have, would be great. A $500 air purifier could make a real difference in pulling infectious bits out of a room before they can infect a person. But it’s possible, some of them speculate, that even a store-bought filter stuck onto a $20 box fan might do some good too. It’s cheap, and while it wouldn’t cut the risk of infection to zero, it would still pull virus-laden particles out of the air. “It hadn’t occurred to me until two days ago, until someone pointed it out,” says José-Luis Jiménez, an aerosol scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, “but I think it’s a brilliant idea.”\n","\n","On a recent Zoom call, environmental engineer Richard Corsi—dean of the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science at Portland State University and an indoor air quality expert—held up a Folgers Coffee box to illustrate for me how a fan at one end, and filters on three or four other sides, could reduce the “pressure drop” that can come from putting a filter in front of a fan and still move (and clean) room-sized volumes of air. “You’ve got me really pumped up on this right now. I don’t have a lot of free time, but this would be something to build a prototype of,” Corsi says. “If it wasn’t for the fact that, you know, we’re still on lockdown, this would be a great fourth-year team project.”\n","\n","Here’s some of the theory: People infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus make more virus. It comes out of their mouths and noses when they talk, sing, breathe, or cough, riding inside blobs of spit and snot that range in size from about the diameter of a human hair to ultra-super-teeny-tiny—like, one could fit inside a single pixel in the sensor of a high-end digital camera. Scientists have long distinguished, somewhat arbitrarily, between larger “droplets” that fling outward ballistically and fall to the ground or some other surface after a couple of meters (unless they get into someone’s eyes, nose, or throat first) and teeny “aerosols”' that float around, vaporlike, borne on winds and breezes. And people infected with Covid-19 but without symptoms—common spreaders of the disease—emit those small, floaty particles.\n","\n","Masks are a good way to keep one’s own self from being a filthy particle-emitter. Nobody wants to be the main character in a super-spreading event, right? But cleaning particles out of the air altogether has seemed like the provenance of building-wide air handling and climate control systems. A hospital HVAC system might cycle all the air in the building a dozen times a day, stale out and fresh in. But what about the rec room of a care home for the elderly, or a public school classroom? Or 50 public school classrooms? Or your house?\n","\n","A little bit of peer-reviewed science says a homebuilt kludge might work. One study, from Singapore and looking not at aerosolized virus but the soot and smoke of Indonesian wildfires, found that a simple filter and fan mounted in a window to pull air inside reduced particulate matter between 1 to 10 microns by around 75 percent. That’s suggestive. The particles in the study were from smoke and soot, but they were well within the size range of the smaller, virus-bearing particles from respiration, which is what counts here.\n","['Wnd Staff', 'Wnd News Editors Compile Reports For Our Readers.', 'Joe Kovacs', 'C.

The government alleged that Bundy, his sons and Montana militia leader Ryan Payne engaged in a massive conspiracy to assault law enforcement officers a few miles from the Bundy ranch.\n","\n","Bureau of Land Management officers engaged in a standoff with the Bundys and their supporters when they tried to execute a court order to round up the family's cattle. The agents eventually backed down.\n","\n","TRENDING: Man who married hologram of 16-year-old runs into big problem amid software issue\n","\n","Cliven Bundy argued it was the state of Nevada, not the U.S., that rightfully owned the lands around his private property on which his cattle grazed.\n","\n","The dismissal was based on the Brady precedent, which states: \"The prosecution is trusted to turn over evidence to the defense because its interest 'is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.'\"\n","\n","The 9th Circuit said the case began with \"a well-publicized effort by the Bureau of Land Management to impound Cliven Bundy's cattle for a twenty-year failure to pay federal grazing fees. Cliven Bundy and hundreds of armed supporters from around the United States forced federal officials to abandon the impoundment plan.\"\n","\n","Then, when the Bundys were on trial, \"the government began disclosing information in its possession that, under Brady, was arguably useful to the defense and should have been produced to the defendants well before trial. As additional documents came forth, the district court held a series of hearings, eventually deciding that the trial could not go forward and that the indictment must be dismissed with prejudice,\" the 9th Circuit said.\n","\n","\"Central to the government's case were allegations that the defendants intentionally lied about being surrounded by snipers as a ploy to gather armed supporters. Had the defendants been able to proffer a basis for genuinely believing that government snipers surrounded the Bundy Ranch, they potentially could have negated the government's … theory. Surveying all the withheld evidence – including surveillance-camera evidence, FBI '302' investigative reports regarding snipers, Tactical Operations Center log records, and threat assessments – the panel held that the record amply supports the district court's conclusion that the defendants suffered substantial prejudice in no being able to prepare their case fully, refine their voir dire strategy, and make stronger opening statements.\"\n","\n","Attorney Larry Klayman, founder of Freedom Watch, said his client, Cliven Bundy, has been \"forced to endure the emotional distress and physical harm of being arrested and denied bail, being thrown in solitary confinement for no valid reason, denied right of counsel and a speedy trial and then, after about two years of illegal incarceration, had to endure a sham and fraudulent trial, where exculpatory evidence was hidden, prosecutors lied to the presiding judge, and where a whistleblower came forward to disclose that there had been a 'kill list' by some agents of the Bureau of Land Management on the heads of the Bundys, is now relieved that this nightmare is over.\"\n","\n","Supporters of the Bundys make their case on the Cliven Bundy Defense Fund website.\n","\n","Klayman, a former Department of Justice lawyer, previously accused the prosecutors' of \"suborning perjury.\"\n","\n","At the time the appeal was pending, Klayman said: \"The Department of Justice, which has sadly become known as the 'Department of Injustice,' is going ahead by with its appeal of the dismissal of the indictment a year ago, characteristically 'circling the wagons' to cover the dishonest and unethical tracks of Steven Mahre, Dan Schiess and other prosecutors in the office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Nevada.\"\n","\n","He said the prosecutors \"were previously caught lying to the court, suborning perjury, threatening whistleblower Larry Wooten and, put simply, committing crimes.\"\n","\n","During the standoff, the government confiscated some of the Bundys' cattle.\n","\n","Klayman has written about the DOJ's actions in his WND columns as well as on the Cliven Bundy Legal Defense Fund site.\n","\n","He said it took \"chutzpah\" for the government to appeal the dismissal of the case by Navarro, who, he said, was \"no friend of Cliven Bundy, his family and the armed peaceful protesters who stood down a tyrannical government at Bunkerville in 2014.\"\n","\n","The prosecutors failed to share evidence of BLM agents \"repeatedly mocking and degrading Mr. Bundy, his family, and his co-defendants in an 'amateurish carnival atmosphere.'\"\n","\n","Also, federal agents bragged \"about roughing up Mr. Bundy's son, Dave, and violently grinding his face into the ground.\"\n","\n","The opinion makes clear the BLM coordinated with multiple agencies and contractors as well as law enforcement agencies and had \"strategically placed at elevated positions around the Bundy residence each evening\" agents with \"binoculars, spotting scopes, night-vision goggles, and thermal-imaging devices.\"\n","\n","And the agents had \"rifles with them at all times.\"\n","\n","Bundy supporters poured into the area and, numbering some 400, they demanded that federal officers leave the impoundment area where 400 cattle had been held. The federal officials eventually left.\n","\n","The subsequent trial was over allegations of impeding officers, threatening law enforcement and extortion.\n","\n","\"The central pillar of the government's case was the allegation that the defendants recruited armed followers by intentionally deceiving those followers into believing that the Bundys feared for their lives because government snipers surrounded their ranch,\" the ruling said.\n","\n","The defendants, in preparing their case, asked for government documents about the snipers, the opinion explained, but didn't receive it.\n","\n","But then the government admitted it had the evidence.\n","\n","The court found the lower court judge had the right to dismiss the indictment \"to implement a remedy for a violation of a recognized statutory or constitutional right.\"\n","['Wnd Staff', 'Wnd News Editors Compile Reports For Our Readers.', 'Joe Kovacs', 'C.

Thanks to a flood of 'cancel culture' activists targeting all things Trump, Parler continues to be 'dead' for all intents and purposes.\n","\n","Gab CEO Andrew Torba, meanwhile, backed up Trump's entire Twitter account despite the fact that Trump hasn't yet joined the network (thanks to Jared Kushner, apparently). Torba has been aggressively lobbying for the president to join. The network says it saw a 750% boost in traffic, adding 600,000 new users in a 24-hour period on Monday alone.\n","\n","\"The traffic just keeps growing. Hang tight, even more servers on the way today,\" Torba wrote on Saturday.\n","\n","Where else are Trump supporters flocking?\n","\n","With Parler currently unpersoned by big tech, and Gab's servers running a little slow thanks to the influx of Twitter and Parler refugees, several other social media apps and platforms are seeing record traffic.\n","\n","Telegram: Before Parler was taken to the woodshed by Amazon, influential users began calling on users to move to messaging app Telegram, where Donald Trump Jr. actively posts in a public channel. The service offers end-to-end encryption outside of Big Tech's grasp, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n","\n","One Telegram channel had over 16,000 \"Parler refugees\" as of Jan. 11, while the service announced on Tuesday that it had attracted 25 million new users globally in the preceding 72 hours, bringing its total active user base to 500 million.\n","\n","The platform supports up to 200,000 members in a group, which is why it's a favorite go-to for protesters in Hong Kong, Iran and Belarus.\n","\n","Signal: Widely regarded as the most 'private' app, Signal's encryption is open source. It also offers encrypted calling and viceo chat. Between last Thursday and Sunday, the app saw around 7.5 million installations from the App Store and Google Play, around 43x more than it received the previous week, according to CNN.\n","\n","The flood of new users has caused some glitches, however, with the company tweeting on Thursday that verification codes for new sign-ups may be delayed \"because so many new people are trying to join Signal right now (we can barely register our excitement).\"\n","\n","\"We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world,\" the company said in a Friday Reddit post.\n","\n","Last week, Signal received some high profile endorsements after Elon Musk, currently the richest man on the planet, tweeted \"Use Signal.\" Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey retweeted it - later posting an image of Signal at the top of the App Store chart after it displaced Parler as the #1 download.\n","\n","Edward Snowden also retweeted Musk, adding \"That's @signalapp, for those who don't speak Elon.\"\n","\n","Other platforms receiving attention of late include; video sharing sites Rumble and BitChute, livestreaming service DLive, along with CloutHub, MeWe and Minds.com.\n","\n","What's out?

The new terms will essentially allow Facebook, WhatsApp's owner, to gain access to certain personal information, such as contact lists, location, financial information and usage data. Since then, WhatsApp's rivals have seen a record-breaking amount of downloads. -nikkei\n","\n","One thing is for sure; with Trump kicked off Twitter, Parler currently dead, and ensuing refugees flocking to a bevy of alternative social media platforms that are siloed from each other, the conservative social media ecosystem has never been more fractured.
